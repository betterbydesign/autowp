## Powders

**Material page name:** Powders

**Hero Description:** Powders, whether for food ingredients or industrial chemicals, clump and generate dust, disrupting efficient product transport. Flexicon's bulk material handling equipment is specifically designed to handle a variety of powders efficiently and reliably.

**Overview:** The term "powder" encompasses a broad range of dry organic or inorganic material in fine particles ranging from spherical to cuboid within a relatively uniform size range. Since most materials do not exist naturally in powder form, they are typically reduced by crushing, grinding or other size reduction methods, which may additionally include washing and screening. The material may also undergo atomization when exceptionally fine particle sizes are specified. In the case of metallic materials, electrolysis may be employed to improve the purity of the product in powdered form.

Bulk material in powder form is utilized across the food, dairy, pharmaceutical, nutritional, chemical, paint/pigment, powdered metal, munitions and other industries. It is widely used to manufacture everyday products such as drink mixes, cocoa, dried milk, whey, vitamins, excipients, ceramic tile, glass, plastics, paper, construction and roofing materials, paint, toothpaste, cosmetics and batteries.

In addition, powder can contain surface spills, filter impurities from water and air, and clean or cut metal surfaces and shapes as an abrasive.

## Match Powder Characteristics to Equipment Capabilities

### Flow Characteristics of Powders

The flow characteristics of powders are affected by the bulk density of the material and the size, shape and cohesiveness of individual particles. Multiple powder blends may include particles of various origins, sizes, shapes, and bulk densities. Ambient moisture, temperature, vibration, or the introduction of dissimilar powders can alter the characteristics of a powder or powder blend, causing it to aerate, fluidize, agglomerate or degrade.

### Handling Different Powder Types

Softer powders, such as [flour](https://www.flexicon.com/Materials-Handled/Flour.html) or [hydrated lime](https://www.flexicon.com/Materials-Handled/Hydrated-Lime.html), may move sluggishly through the production line and tend to "bridge" or "rat hole," impeding flow in process vessels. Light, fluffy powders such as [fumed silica](https://www.flexicon.com/Materials-Handled/Fumed-Silica.html) or [talc](https://www.flexicon.com/Materials-Handled/Talc.html) tend to aerate, blinding filters and seeping into the plant environment. [Carbon black](https://www.flexicon.com/Materials-Handled/Carbon-Black.html) and [titanium dioxide](https://www.flexicon.com/Materials-Handled/Titanium-Dioxide.html) powders are difficult to handle as they pack or smear, bridging or "rat holing" in the process stream, significantly reducing efficiency; both are notorious for potentially binding or jamming moving components and incurring labor-intensive and time-consuming cleanup efforts.

[Milk powder](https://www.flexicon.com/Materials-Handled/Milk-Powder.html), other dairy powder, and powders containing high-fat content may build up on the conveying line, raising the risk of product contamination and causing flow problems. Micronized [salt](https://www.flexicon.com/Materials-Handled/Salt.html) or [sand](https://www.flexicon.com/Materials-Handled/Silica-Sand.html) can be corrosive and abrasive, damaging conveying lines and other powder-handling equipment. Blends of powders comprised of disparate particle sizes, shapes and/or bulk densities are prone to separation, reducing product quality and generating waste.

### Dust Management and Safety

Conveying, filling, discharging, blending, and other processes in which powder is moved tend to generate dust that can contaminate the plant environment and pose a health risk. Containing dust generated while handling powders is a priority for most processors. In the United States, the [Occupational Safety and Health Administration](https://www.osha.gov/shib) (OSHA) has identified dust as one element in the Explosion Pentagon.

In most industrialized nations, regulations require that additional steps be taken during the handling of powder to prevent it from escaping into the outside atmosphere, where it can settle on motors, lamps, or other heat sources, increasing the likelihood of an incident.

In addition, escaping dust can contaminate other materials and pose a health risk for nearby operators. Some powders are water-reactive, meaning exposure to moisture may trigger a chemical reaction that leads to unexpected heat that releases toxic or flammable gas. The heat generated from such a reaction can be sufficient to cause either spontaneous combustion or an explosion. For most other types of powder, adding moisture will cause particles to agglomerate, altering flow characteristics.

A fundamental safeguard against these and other powder-related problems is to utilize dust-tight processing equipment and connections to upstream and downstream process equipment and storage vessels. This prevents dust from escaping and excess moisture or contaminants from occurring.

### Bulk Bag Handling

Flexicon [Bulk Bag Dischargers](https://www.flexicon.com/Bulk-Handling-Equipment-and-Systems/Bulk-Bag-Dischargers/) form a secure, dust-tight connection between the bag spout and the equipment inlet for unloading powder from bulk bags, creating a sealed system. Available [flow promotion devices](https://www.flexicon.com/Bulk-Handling-Equipment-and-Systems/Bulk-Bag-Dischargers/Options.html) promote the evacuation of powder from the bag. These include spring-loaded frames that stretch the top of the bag upward as it empties and elongates, causing powder to flow from corners of the bag, and pneumatically actuated flow promotion devices that massage the bag and direct non-free-flowing powders into the bag spout.

To prevent dust escape in the event of a leak and/or when incoming powders displace air, the sealed system can be vented to a dust collector that puts the entire system under vacuum. This provides the added benefit of collapsing empty bags before tie-off and removal, preventing dust generated when empty bags are flattened manually.

### Filling Bulk Bags

When filling bulk bags with powders, dust can be contained by making secure connections between the material feed source and the bulk bag filler inlet. Flexicon [Bulk Bag Fillers' inflatable spout seal](https://www.flexicon.com/Bulk-Handling-Equipment-and-Systems/Bulk-Bag-Fillers/) creates a secure, dust-tight connection to the bulk bag inlet. The sealed system is vented to a filter sock or optional [dust collection system](https://www.flexicon.com/Bulk-Handling-Equipment-and-Systems/Bulk-Bag-Dischargers/Cleanliness.html) to prevent displaced air and dust from entering the plant environment. Flexicon Bulk Bag Fillers have vibratory decks that deaerate and densify the material to stabilize bulk bags filled with powders.

### Manual and Larger Container Dumping

When manually dumping powders from bags, sacks, and other hand-held packaging, a Flexicon [Manual Dumping Station](https://www.flexicon.com/Bulk-Handling-Equipment-and-Systems/Bag-Dump-Stations/) with a dust collection hood is recommended. A vacuum draws dust generated during dumping activities away from the worker and puts it onto filter cartridges. Reverse-pulse cleaning of each filter on an alternating cycle returns accumulated dust to the hopper, preventing waste while maintaining continuous operational efficiency.

When dumping powders received in larger containers, Flexicon [Drum/Box/Container Dumpers](https://www.flexicon.com/Bulk-Handling-Equipment-and-Systems/Drum-Box-Container-Dumpers/) hydraulically raise and rotate the container, creating a dust-tight seal against a discharge hood that mates with a gasketed inlet port fitted to any receiving vessel. A slide gate valve at the discharge hood outlet allows the powder flow into the receiving vessel to be started and stopped as needed, allowing total or partial discharge of the container's contents, all dust-free.

### Conveying Powders

Converting powders hinges on application parameters that are too numerous to cover here. However, Flexicon [Dilute-phase Pneumatic Conveying Systems](https://www.flexicon.com/Bulk-Handling-Equipment-and-Systems/Pneumatic-Conveyors/) and Flexicon [Tubular Cable Conveyors](https://www.flexicon.com/Bulk-Handling-Equipment-and-Systems/Tubular-Cable-Conveyors/) are both generally recommended for dry, free-flowing powders that do not tend to pack, cake or smear. In contrast, Flexicon [Flexible Screw Conveyors](https://www.flexicon.com/Bulk-Handling-Equipment-and-Systems/Flexible-Screw-Conveyors/) are suitable for both free-flowing and non-free-flowing powders, including those that pack, cake or smear.

In the case of dilute-phase pneumatic conveying of powders, especially toxic powders, vacuum systems may be specified instead of pressure systems to contain dust in case of a leak in the system.
