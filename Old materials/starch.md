## Starch

**Material page name:** Starch

**Hero Description:** Starch is a versatile carbohydrate used in food and industrial applications. It is highly susceptible to dusting and compaction, and improper handling poses a significant explosion risk. Flexicon bulk material handling equipment offers efficient transport solutions that preserve starch consistency.

**Overview:** Starch is the most common carbohydrate in the human diet and is found in many staple foods. The primary starch sources worldwide are cereals (rice, wheat, and maize) and root vegetables (potatoes and cassava). As an additive for food processing, starches are typically used as thickeners and stabilizers in foods such as puddings, custards, soups, sauces, gravies, pie fillings, salad dressings, and noodles and pasta.

Papermaking is the largest non-food application for starch globally, consuming millions of metric tons annually. Another extensive non-food starch application is in the construction industry, where starch is used in gypsum wallboard manufacturing. Starch is used to manufacture various adhesives or glues for book-binding, wallpaper adhesives, paper sack production, tube winding, gummed paper, envelope adhesives, school glues and bottle labeling.

Clothing or laundry starch is a liquid prepared by mixing vegetable starch in water. It is used to wash clothes and is sold in aerosol cans for home use.

## Characteristics and Challenges

Generally, starches are dry, fine, powdery substances. Starches have different flow characteristics depending on the plant source from which they are derived and other variables. Moisture content critically affects the flowability of this material. Dry starches tend to flow out of pipes or screw conveyors when the conveyor stops. However, starches with a higher moisture content may clump and be challenging to move.

### Moisture Impact

Starch stored for long periods without movement or agitation may not flow easily. Conversely, repeated transfers of starch from one container to another also affect the flowability, as fines tend to separate from the bottom with each transfer, changing the particle distribution. Starch also settles quickly and spoils easily.

### Handling Challenges

Faulty conveying of starch in the manufacturing and/or packaging processes can reduce production with unnecessary downtime, cleaning, maintenance and product loss, and it can also be dangerous.

### Safety Considerations

Starch dust can produce an extremely explosive mixture with air. All motors in confined areas must have explosion-proof ratings. All conveying equipment and storage silos must be grounded to prevent static electricity. A static relief valve in the storage silo is also recommended if a [starch "bridge" collapses and causes the silo to cave in](https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/6697050/mod_resource/content/1/maurer2009.pdf).

### Flow Promotion

To be consistently successful with the flow promotion of starch, operators must consider the vessels used to transport starch to their processing sites. Starch cakes and packs quickly and tends to fluidize, meaning the fine starch particles take on characteristics of a liquid.

### Reducing Moisture Impact

Moisture content is the most critical property that affects the flowability of starch. Starch shipped by railcar or stored for extended periods in silos stands a greater potential for moisture exposure. As a result, if the starch is being pneumatically conveyed into a processing system, the blower used to move the airline must be sized to meet the system. If ambient or storage vessel moisture is an issue, an inline air dryer that is powerful enough to extract the moisture is an effective aid in maintaining starch flow.

### Bulk Bag Handling

If the starch arrives at the processing facility in large bulk bags, the frames used to discharge the bags usually require additional accessories to empty the bags and prevent any fine starch particles from escaping into the surrounding atmosphere. If the starch is packaged in smaller (>50 lb) bags, a bag-emptying station with a dust hood, filtration devices and a pneumatic pulse cleaner may be sufficient to support the manual unloading of the material.

### Preventing Blockages

Starch will tend to "rat hole" or bridge in hoppers, completely blocking the flow of the material, causing a shutdown while it is removed and elevating the risk of starch dusting or spillage. Feed hoppers should be designed with proper geometry and a surface that is as smooth as possible. They may need to incorporate devices such as air fluidizers or vibrators to dislodge starch from hopper walls or mechanical agitators to promote flow. A hopper screen above the receiving vessel will help protect the operators if the starch is being manually dumped into a hopper equipped with agitating devices.

### Flexible Screw Conveying

If a flexible screw is being used to convey the starch, it is vital to use a screw that matches the starch's characteristics and other application requirements. Generally, a screw with a wider, flatter surface than the standard-sized screw is necessary for moving starch up an incline.
