## Sulfur

**Material page name:** Sulfur

**Hero Description:** Sulfur, available in granular or powdered form, is vital in fertilizer and chemical manufacturing. However, its hazardous nature requires sensitive transport and storage. Flexicon bulk material handling equipment is designed to control dusting, ensuring product quality and operator safety.

**Overview:** Sulfur is a bright yellow, combustible, non-metallic element found naturally worldwide. Its pure form is odorless, but sulfur compounds can cause the smell usually associated with it.

Some of the earliest recorded references to sulfur are found in scripture passages that refer to sulfur as "brimstone" and associate it with Divine Punishment. This contrasts with the use of sulfur by other early civilizations as a balm for [skin disorders such as acne vulgaris, rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis, dandruff, pityriasis versicolor, scabies, and warts](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15303787/).

Sulfur is the primary source of sulfuric acid, arguably the most widely used chemical in the world. It is used to manufacture fertilizer, oil refining, wastewater processing, mineral extraction, vulcanizing rubber, and nylon. Sulfur is also a component of gunpowder. In the paper-making process, it is also used as a bleaching agent and electrical insulator.

Sulfur is popular with mineral collectors due to its yellow color and crystalline shapes. The spelling of sulfur varies worldwide, with "sulphur" predominant in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, India, South Africa and Australia. However, many scientific societies, including the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) and the Royal Society of Chemistry Nomenclature Committee, adopted the spelling of "sulfur" in the 1990s. It is now considered the official spelling.

## Characteristics and Challenges

Most powdered or micronized sulfur grades have an [average bulk density of 41 lb/ft³](https://hapman.com/resources-knowledge/tools/bulk-density-guide/) (656.76 kg/m³). In granular form, the average bulk density is closer to 29 lb/cu ft (464.54 kg/cu m).

### Challenges to Conveying Sulfur

The main challenges to conveying sulfur are its corrosiveness and the risk of explosion and fire. Sulfur dust suspended in the air ignites easily and burns with explosive violence. Ignition can be caused by [friction, static electricity, sparks, or heat](https://www.georgiagulfsulfur.com/safety/sulfur-fires). Toxic gases may form after combustion. Handlers often face stringent regulations to contain sulfur during and after processing. Explosion protection devices may be necessary to help protect people and property in and near the processing facility.

### Handling Corrosiveness and Abrasiveness

Sulfur can be abrasive and corrosive, so equipment must withstand prolonged exposure. If sulfur is pneumatically conveyed into a processing system, the blower used to move this material through the airline must be sized to meet the system's demands. 316-grade stainless steel is usually recommended for any equipment exposed to sulfur.

### Addressing Non-Free-Flowing Sulfur

Some sulfur grades can be non-free-flowing, so if the sulfur arrives at the processing facility in bulk bags, the frames used to discharge the bags should be equipped with additional accessories to reduce operator intervention when emptying the sulfur. This includes features such as spring-loaded frames that stretch the bags as they empty and lighten, making them rigid and removing any pockets of sulfur cornered in the bags. Bag-activating devices are usually practical in dislodging collections of sulfur, promoting a better flow. Some bag-activating devices also serve as a dust-tight seal between the bulk bag and the receiving hopper.

### Managing Airborne Dust

After the bulk bag has been connected to the receiving hopper and the sulfur begins to flow, the air inside the hopper is forced out. Unless this displaced air passes through a filter, airborne dust particles can escape into the surrounding atmosphere, creating a potentially hazardous situation. A dust collector mounted on the discharger frame will contain the sulfur inside the conveyance system. Sulfur dust trapped in the filter media can be returned to the receiving hopper by a pneumatic pulse through the filter.

### Solutions for Smaller Bag Handling

If the sulfur is being added into the processing stream from smaller bags, a bag-breaking station with a dust hood, filtration devices, and a pneumatic pulse cleaner is recommended to support the manual unloading of the material. If empty bag disposal is an issue, a dust-tight bag compacting system may be necessary.

### Managing Poor Flow Characteristics

With its poor flowing characteristics, sulfur may tend to "rat hole" or bridge in hoppers, interrupting the proper flow of the material. Because of this, feed hoppers should be designed with proper geometry and may need to incorporate mechanical agitators, vibrators or air fluidizers to promote flow. A hopper grate above the receiving vessel will help prevent the introduction of foreign objects and protect the operators from moving equipment inside the hoppers.

### Flexible Screw Conveying

If a flexible screw is being used to convey the sulfur, it is vital to use a screw that matches sulfur's characteristics and other application requirements. Generally, a screw with a wider, flatter surface than the standard-sized screw is necessary for this type of material.

### Bulk Bag Capacity and Seals

Should your sulfur application involve loading material into bulk bags, the bag capacity will be maximized by using a vibratory densification deck to level the sulfur as it fills the bag and load cells to attain the desired weight. Seals and other dust containment devices will ensure a dust-tight operation.
