## Silica Sand

**Material page name:** Silica Sand

**Hero Description:** Silica sand, essential in glassmaking and construction, is a dense and highly abrasive particulate that requires reliable handling equipment. Flexicon's durable bulk material handling equipment is built to withstand harsh conditions, providing smooth transport while protecting the material and the machinery.

**Overview:** Most people first encounter silica sand during childhood while playing in sandboxes or playgrounds. Unlike beach sand, mainly derived from limestone, silica sand is made of quartz crystals, abundant in the earth's crust. The crystals are extracted by mining and then processed into various grades of silica sand. Also known as quartz or industrial sand, silica sand is essential for various industrial and construction uses. The use of silica sand is determined by its structure and physical properties. For example, the [chemical composition of silica sand](https://static.ags.aer.ca/files/document/ESR/ESR_1971_04.pdf#:~:text=according%20to%20the%20use%20to%20which%20the,glassmaking%2C%20whereas%20grain%20angularity%20and%20hardness%20are.) is highly relevant when used in glassmaking. At the same time, the grain hardness is an important facet when the sand is used for sandblasting.

Among the significant applications of silica sand are as an abrasive to grind and polish metal, as part of the content of building products such as bricks and roofing tiles, in glassmaking, as a refractory agent and as a proppant in the hydraulic fracturing of gas and oil wells. It is also used in manufacturing paints, as a filtration material for water and other potable liquid systems and in golf courses, volleyball and other athletic fields.

The characteristics of silica sand that determine its use are cleanliness (which refers to the ratio of silt, clay and organic matter in any measure of sand), color (shades of brown or orange indicate the presence of impurities such as iron oxides), grain size, shape, particle size range and refractoriness (melting point).

## Characteristics and Challenges

Due to the material's abrasive characteristics, a silica sand conveying system must be rugged enough to withstand the impact of the sand on the interior surfaces and moving parts of the convey line and equipment. With an [average bulk density of 81 lbs/ftÂ³](https://dynamicbulk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bulk-Material-Density-Property-Chart.pdf), silica sand is generally free-flowing. Sand particles entering gears, valves or other fine-motion equipment could damage them and permanently reduce performance quality.

### Shape, Purity, and Health Hazards

In some applications, the shape and purity of the silica sand are important, so care must be taken to avoid degradation while handling it. The very fine particles of sand can pose a health hazard, as breathing in the dust can cause silicosis, which, in severe cases, can be disabling or even fatal. Coarser particles of silica sand tend to interlock, potentially impeding their flow into downstream processing equipment.

### Air-Line Velocity and Equipment Selection

Due to the degradable nature of silica sand, care must also be taken to maintain an air-line velocity during pneumatic conveying that does not damage it. The blower used to move the sand through the convey line must be sized to meet the system. Above all, preventing silica sand's abrasive properties from damaging the convey line should be a top priority. Equipment selection is paramount to ensure the longevity of the system.

### Bulk Bag Discharging

If the silica sand arrives at the processing facility in bulk bags, the frames used to discharge the bags should ideally be equipped with additional accessories to empty the silica sand from the bag completely. This includes features such as spring-loaded frames that will elongate and stretch the bags, making them rigid and removing any pockets of silica sand cornered in the bags. Some bag-activating devices also serve as a dust seal between the bulk bag and the receiving hopper.

### Dust Suppression and Post-Discharge Handling

After the bulk bag has been connected to the receiving hopper and the silica sand begins to flow, the air inside the hopper is forced out. Dust suppression during the dumping and de-gassing of the bulk bags can be achieved by using a high-volume fan drawing dust into cartridge filters. This arrangement can also act as a vacuum that completely evacuates the bulk bags post-discharge, eliminating the potential dusting that could occur when the bags are removed and folded before storage or disposal. The cartridge filters can also be activated by an automatic reverse-pulse filter cleaner that returns the filtered silica sand dust to the receiving hopper, reducing material waste and lowering the risk of a potentially dangerous dusting.

### Small Bag Feeding

If the sand is fed into the processing system from smaller bags, a bag-breaking station with a dust hood, filtration devices, and a pneumatic pulse cleaner is recommended to support the manual unloading of the material. A hopper screen above the receiving vessel will help prevent the introduction of foreign objects and protect the operators from moving components inside the hopper.

### Flexible Screw Conveying

If a flexible screw is being used to convey the silica sand, it is essential to use a screw that matches the silica sand's characteristics and other application requirements. Generally, a screw with a round profile will be effective in moving material with silica sand's features. Due to silica sand's abrasive nature, a flexible screw with a heavy-duty design is recommended.

### Bulk Bag Filling and Dust Containment

If your silica sand application involves loading the material into bulk bags, the bag capacity will be maximized by using a vibratory densification deck to level the sand as it fills the bag and load cells to achieve the desired weight. Seals and other dust containment devices will ensure a dust-tight operation.
