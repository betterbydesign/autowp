## Plastics

**Material page name:** Plastics

**Hero Description:** Plastics, available in pellet or powder form, are essential to manufacturing processes. Flexicon bulk material handling equipment ensures smooth transport and minimizes contamination and waste.

**Overview:** "Plastic" is a generic term for a multitude of materials. Now one of the most-used materials in the world, the earliest forms of plastic date back to the mid-19th century. However, it wasn't until the 1940s and World War II that shortages of products such as rubber and iron spurred the rapid development of plastic as a substitute for these natural resources. The first decade after the war saw the [development of polypropylene and high-density polyethylene](https://www.acs.org/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/polypropylene.html#:~:text=In%20less%20than%20a%20year,on%20the%20original%20chromium%20catalyst.&text=A%20lot%20of%20empiricism%20and,Courtesy%20Phillips%20Petroleum%20Company.) and the growth of new plastics in many applications.

Generally, plastic is engineered to have enhanced mechanical properties and often greater durability than other materials. For example, polycarbonate plastic is used to resist impact. Polyamides like nylon resists abrasion. Plastic fibers are plastic spun into filaments for fabric, string, ropes, cables and optical fibers. Some of the most recognizable plastic fibers are polyester, nylon and rayon. There are also plastic coatings and plastic adhesives.

## Plastic Types and Processing Methods

Plastics are grouped into two general classes: thermoplastics and thermosets.

### Thermoplastics

Thermoplastics are polymers that melt when heated, can be formed or shaped in that state, and solidify when cooled. They can be re-melted and essentially returned to their original state. Thermoplastics are usually produced separately to create small pellets, which are then heated and formed to make other products. Examples of thermoplastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, nylon, and polycarbonate.

### Commodity vs. Specialty Resins

Industrial fabricators consider plastics a "commodity" or "specialty" resins. Commodity resins are plastics produced at high volume and low cost for the most common disposable and durable goods. They are represented chiefly by polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polystyrene.

Specialty resins are plastics whose properties are tailored to specific applications and produced at low volume and higher cost. Among this group are the so-called engineering plastics, which can compete with die-cast metals in plumbing, hardware, and automotive applications. Important [engineering plastics](https://www.britannica.com/science/plastic), less familiar to consumers than the commodity plastics listed above, are polyacetal, polyamide (aka trade name nylon), polytetrafluoroethylene (trademark Teflon), polycarbonate, polyphenylene sulfide, epoxy, and polyetheretherketone.

### Thermosets

Thermosets are a separate class of polymers that can be formed when heated. Unlike thermoplastics, thermosets remain in a permanent state once molded. Thermosets include vulcanized synthetic rubber, acrylics, polyurethanes, melamine, silicone, and epoxies. The reaction used to produce thermosetting plastics is not always heat--sometimes, a [chemical reaction between specialized materials](https://www.simtec-silicone.com/blogs/thermoplastics-and-thermosetting-plastics-why-they-work-together/#:~:text=Thermoset%20encompasses%20a%20category%20of,Types%20of%20Thermosetting%20Materials) is sufficient to produce the desired result.

**Characteristics and Challenges:**

### Resin Conversion

Converting granules, flakes or powders (aka resins) into various shapes typically involves sourcing them into an extruder (thermoplastics) or a mold (thermosets), where they are melted and formed into a continuous profile or shape. These resins can also have varying properties, including density and flow characteristics.

### Bulk Bag Discharge

If the resin arrives at the processing facility in bulk bags, the frames used to discharge the bags should be equipped with additional accessories designed to facilitate the transfer of the material from the bulk bag to either a conveyor or directly into an inlet on the extruder or mold. These devices can elongate and stretch the bags, promoting a better flow and removing any pockets of cornered resin. Some bag-activating devices offer a dust-tight seal between the bulk bag spout and the receiving vessel.

### Pneumatic Conveying

If the resin is discharged from a bulk bag into conveying equipment before reaching an extruder or a mold, it will first flow into a receiving hopper. As the resin fills the hopper, the air inside that vessel is forced out. Airborne dust particles can escape into the surrounding atmosphere unless this air passes through a filter. A dust collector mounted on the discharger frame will contain the dust inside the conveyance system, lowering the risk of potentially dangerous dusting and reducing the time necessary to perform the routine cleaning typically required in most processing environments.

### Flow Promotion Devices

Feed hoppers should be designed with proper geometry. Unless the resin is free-flowing, they should incorporate devices such as vibrators to promote flow.

### Manual Handling

If the resin is packaged in smaller bags, a bag dumping station with a dust hood and filtration devices may be sufficient to support the manual unloading of the material in hoppers. A hopper screen above the receiving vessel will help to prevent the introduction of foreign objects and protect the operators from potentially dangerous conveying equipment. Some plastics processing includes blending various powders with the resin prior to extrusion or molding. These powders may add different characteristics, including dusting or hygroscopic agglomeration, which will need attention.

### Flexible Screw Conveying

If a flexible screw is being used to convey the resin, it is vital to use a screw that matches the plastic's characteristics and other application requirements. Generally, a round screw is necessary for moving resin up an incline.

### Pneumatic Conveying Systems

If the resin is being pneumatically conveyed into a processing system, the blower used to move resin through the airline must be sized to meet the system's demands.

### Abrasive Resins

Due to the abrasive nature of some plastic pellets, such as mineral- or glass-filled pellets, care must be taken to avoid excessive use of bends or sweeps in the convey line, as these are prone to wear and failure. The motion of the pelletized resins skidding along the convey line often creates friction, and the subsequent heat can melt the pellet surfaces, creating streamers or "angel hair" that can cause downstream quality problems. Deflection elbows can mitigate the problems of excessive elbow wear and the formation of "snakeskins," or streamers.
