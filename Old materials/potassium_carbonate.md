## Potassium Carbonate

**Material page name:** Potassium Carbonate

**Hero Description:** Potassium carbonate is a white, crystalline substance widely used in glass and chemical production. Due to its hygroscopic properties, it can absorb moisture, disrupt flow, and reduce efficiency. Flexicon bulk material handling equipment minimizes product loss for precise batching.

**Overview:** Potassium carbonate is also known as potash, pearl ash, salt of tartar, carbonate of potash, and salt of wormwood. It is a white, translucent, odorless, granular or crystalline material that absorbs water from the air. It is a mild alkali used in making soap and glass. Historically, it was derived from the boiled ashes of hardwood trees (hence the term "potash.")

Today, potassium carbonate is prepared for commercial use through the electrolysis of potassium chloride. An estimated 7 million metric tons of potassium carbonate are produced annually in the United States. While still used to produce glass and detergents, it is also used to produce fertilizers, photographic chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food products, cement and textiles.

**Characteristics and Challenges:** Most grades of potassium carbonate have an average bulk density of 20 lb/ftÂ³. Some grades of [potassium carbonate carry an HMIS Health rating of 2](https://www.asp-inc.com/products/documents/prodinfo/k/kcarbmsd.pdf), meaning hazardous in case of eye contact (irritant) or inhalation (lung irritant) and slightly hazardous in case of skin contact (irritant, sensitizer).

### Physical Form

Typically crystalline in form, potassium carbonate may also be micronized. Potassium carbonate is hygroscopic, meaning that moisture, humidity and temperature may impact its flow. In granular form, potassium carbonate can be abrasive, so the equipment used to convey it should be able to withstand any potential effects from prolonged contact. If micronized, potassium carbonate can agglomerate in the processing system. Consultation on your application for potassium carbonate with an experienced material handling equipment provider is recommended.

### Handling Bulk Bags

If the potassium carbonate has been transported to the facility in bulk bags, the frames used to discharge the bags may still require additional accessories to empty the potassium carbonate from the bag completely. This includes spring-loaded frames that will elongate and stretch the bags as they empty and lighten, removing any pockets of cornered potassium carbonate. Bag-activating devices are usually effective in agitating the potassium carbonate, dislodging collections of potassium carbonate, and promoting a better flow. Some bag-activating devices also serve as an airtight seal between the bulk bag and the receiving hopper.

### Handling Smaller Bags

If the potassium carbonate is packaged in smaller bags, a bag-breaking station with a dust hood and filter cartridges is likely sufficient to support the manual unloading of the material. A pneumatic pulse can clean the filters and return the trapped potassium carbonate to the receiving hopper.

### Dust Control

As the potassium carbonate fills the receiving hopper, the air inside the vessel is forced out. If this air passes through a static filter, the possibility of airborne potassium carbonate dust particles escaping into the surrounding atmosphere is increased, especially if the material is micronized. A dust collector mounted on the discharger frame will contain the potassium carbonate dust inside the conveyance system. This not only lowers the amount of housekeeping efforts necessary, but the collector can also reduce product waste if equipped with a reverse pulse jet that pneumatically cleans the filter media, returning the collected potassium carbonate to the receiving hopper.

### Hopper Design

The geometry of the feed hoppers is another important aspect of handling potassium carbonate. To guarantee flow within the hopper, devices such as vibrators or mechanical agitators may need to be incorporated to promote flow. A hopper screen above the receiving vessel will help protect the operators if the potassium carbonate is manually dumped into a hopper equipped with agitating devices.

### Pneumatic Conveyance

If potassium carbonate is pneumatically conveyed into a processing system, the blower used to move it through the air must be sized to meet the system's demands. Because potassium carbonate tends to absorb moisture from the air and may agglomerate, additional devices may be required to reduce the humidity levels or draw moisture from it before entering the conveyor.

### Flexible Screw Conveying

Due to potassium carbonate's crystalline form and its free-flowing nature, a round screw design is commonly used for flexible screw conveying.

### Bulk Bag Loading

If your potassium carbonate application involves loading micronized potassium carbonate into bulk bags, the capacity of the bags can be maximized by using vibratory densification decks that de-aerate the potassium carbonate as it fills the bags. In contrast, using load cells will ensure that the bags are consistently filled to the desired weight.
