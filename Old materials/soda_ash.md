## Soda Ash

**Material page name:** Soda Ash

**Hero Description:** Soda ash, a fine, granular material vital in glass and detergent manufacturing, is prone to caking, which disrupts flow and reduces quality. Flexicon's bulk material handling equipment is designed for efficient transfer, accurate batching, and seamless handling, preserving its integrity.

**Overview:** The average American citizen is probably unaware that the production of sodium carbonate, also known as soda ash, is used to measure the strength of the nation's economy. Soda ash has applications in both the automobile and construction industries, meaning production trends of soda ash can, qualitatively at least, indicate near-term economic activity.

Also known as washing soda and its chemical symbol Na₂CO₃, natural soda ash is refined from trona or sodium-carbonate-bearing brines. It can also be chemically reproduced using the Solvay method.

Nearly half of the soda ash produced in the United States annually is used to manufacture glass. Other applications of soda ash include manufacturing chemicals, paper and detergents.

## Characteristics and Challenges

Generally, soda ash is free-flowing, granular and may be mildly abrasive. Soda ash has three primary grades --- light, medium and dense. These have the same chemical properties and only differ in physical characteristics, such as bulk density, particle size, and shape (which affect flow characteristics and angle of repose).

### Pneumatic Conveying Considerations

If soda ash is pneumatically conveyed into a processing system, the blower used to move it through the convey line must be sized to meet the system's demands. Because soda ash is degradable, care must be taken to maintain an air-line velocity that does not damage the material.

### Bulk Bag Handling

If the soda ash arrives at the processing facility in bulk bags, the frames used to discharge the bags should be equipped with additional accessories to empty the soda ash from the bag completely. This includes features such as spring-loaded frames that will stretch the bags as they empty and lighten, making them rigid and removing any residual accumulations of material in the bags. Bag-activating devices are usually effective in agitating the soda ash, dislodging agglomerations and promoting a better flow. Some bag-activating devices also serve as a dust-tight seal between the bulk bag and the receiving hopper.

### Dust Control and Safety Measures

Soda ash has been identified as an eye and lung irritant, meaning the systems used to transport it should be equipped with dust collection devices. After the bulk bag containing soda ash has been connected to the receiving hopper and the product begins to flow, the air inside the hopper is forced out. Airborne dust particles can escape into the surrounding atmosphere unless this air passes through a filter. A dust collector mounted on the discharger frame will contain the soda ash inside the conveyance system, lowering the risk of potentially dangerous dusting. Soda ash dust trapped in the filter media can be returned to the receiving hopper by a pneumatic pulse through the filter. This reduces waste and the time necessary to perform the routine cleaning and sanitation typically required in most chemical processing environments.

### Hopper Flow Solutions

Coarser soda ash particles will tend to interlock in hoppers, impeding their flow into downstream processing equipment. To promote flow, the feed hoppers may need to incorporate mechanical agitators or vibrators.

### Small Bag Handling

If the soda ash is packaged in smaller bags, a bag dumping station with a dust hood and filtration devices may be sufficient to support the manual unloading of the material in hoppers. A bag compactor connected to the dumping station will permit operators to pass empty bags directly to a compactor, creating a dust-contained disposal method for the empty bags.

A hopper screen above the receiving vessel will help to prevent the introduction of foreign objects and protect the operators from potentially dangerous conveying equipment. If a flexible screw is being used to convey the soda ash, it is vital to use a screw that matches the material's characteristics and other application requirements.

Generally, a screw with a round profile will be effective in moving soda ash to a filling machine undamaged and with no separation of fine particles.

### Bulk Bag Loading Considerations

If your soda ash application involves loading the material into bulk bags, the bag capacity will be maximized. A vibratory densification deck will de-aerate the soda ash as it fills the bag, and load cells will be applied to achieve the desired weight. Seals and other dust containment devices will ensure a dust-tight operation.
