## Cornmeal

**Material page name:** Cornmeal

**Hero Description:** Cornmeal is a fine, grain-based material prone to dusting and moisture absorption. Flexicon bulk handling equipment ensures accurate conveyance that maintains product integrity.

**Overview:** Also known as Indian Meal, cornmeal is essentially whole corn kernels ground into smaller particles. The grinding process normally involves either traditional (stone) or modern (steel) grinding equipment. Stone-ground cornmeal retains more of the hull and germ of a corn kernel, which results in more flavor and nutritional value. However, steel-ground cornmeal has a longer shelf life than stone-ground cornmeal.

Cornmeal is used to produce tortillas, cornbread, muffins, fritters, hush puppies and spoon bread. It is also used as an ingredient in products such as cornmeal mixes, cereals, bakery and pancake mixes and snack foods. A finer granulation of cornmeal is sold as corn cones which are used in many bakery mixes or as dusting meal for pizzas, English muffins, and other similar products.

Due to cornmeal's caloric and high-quality protein content, [three different cornmeal products are purchased by the U.S. government](https://namamillers.org/international/humanitarian-assistance/) for distribution under its food donation program. These products are regular cornmeal, soy-fortified cornmeal and corn soy blend (CSB).

**Characteristics and Challenges:** Many grades and granulations of cornmeal are available. Most grades of cornmeal have an average bulk density of 40 lbs/cu ft. The particle size of cornmeal may influence the texture and "mouth feel" of the final product. Generally, [finer particles of cornmeal will produce a softer "bite,"](https://books.google.com/books/about/Snack_Food.html?id=Ui3UBwAAQBAJ) while larger particles are desired for foods that are expected to exhibit a more crunchy texture. Fine particles tend to separate to the bottom of the vessel, potentially resulting in an undesirable segregation of cornmeal particles during processing.

### Bulk Bag Discharge for Cornmeal

If the cornmeal arrives at the processing facility in bulk bags, the frames used to discharge the bags should ideally be equipped with additional accessories to completely empty the cornmeal from the bag. This includes features such as spring-loaded frames that will stretch the bags as they empty and lighten, making them rigid and removing any residual accumulations of cornmeal in the bags. Bag-activating devices are usually effective in agitating the cornmeal, dislodging collections of cornmeal to promote a better flow. Some of these bag-activating devices also serve as a dust-tight seal between the bulk bag and the receiving hopper.

### Combustible Dust Concerns in Cornmeal Processing

The dust generated during cornmeal processing has been identified as combustible dust. Dust containment methods are a crucial feature to consider when conveying cornmeal.

After the bulk bag has been connected to the receiving hopper and the cornmeal begins to flow, the air inside the hopper is forced out. Unless this air passes through a filter, airborne dust particles can escape into the surrounding atmosphere. A dust collector mounted on the discharger frame will contain the cornmeal inside the conveyance system, lowering the risk of a potentially dangerous dusting. Cornmeal dust trapped in the filter media can be returned to the receiving hopper by a pneumatic pulse through the filter. This reduces waste and the time necessary to perform the routine cleaning and sanitation typically required in most food processing environments.

### Flow Challenges with Coarse Cornmeal

Coarser particles of cornmeal will tend to interlock in hoppers, impeding its flow into downstream processing equipment. To promote flow, the feed hoppers may need to incorporate devices such as mechanical agitators or vibrators.

### Manual Unloading of Smaller Bags

If the cornmeal is packaged in smaller bags, a bag-breaking station with a dust hood, filtration devices and a pneumatic pulse cleaner is the recommended solution to support the manual unloading of the material. A hopper screen above the receiving vessel will help to prevent the introduction of foreign objects and protect the operators if the cornmeal is being dumped manually into a hopper that is equipped with agitating devices.

### Pneumatic Conveying of Cornmeal

If the cornmeal is being pneumatically conveyed into a processing system, the blower used to move the cornmeal though the convey line must be sized to meet the system. Care must be taken to ensure that cornmeal's sometimes abrasive properties do not damage the convey line.

### Flexible Screw Conveyors for Cornmeal

If a flexible screw is being used to convey the cornmeal, it is important to use a screw that matches the cornmeal's characteristics and other application requirements. Generally, a screw with a round profile will be effective in moving material with cornmeal's characteristics (including dissimilar particle sizes, bulk densities and flow characteristics) to a filling machine undamaged and with no separation of blended products.

### Bulk Bag Loading

Should your cornmeal application feature the loading of the material into bulk bags, the bag capacity will be maximized by the use of a vibratory densification deck to de-aerate the cornmeal as it fills the bag and by the application of load cells to achieve the desired weight. Seals and other dust containment devices will ensure a dust-tight operation.
