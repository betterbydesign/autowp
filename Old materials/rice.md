## Rice

**Material page name:** Rice

**Hero Description:** Rice, a staple food grain, requires precise bulk handling systems to ensure clean, efficient transport. Otherwise, transport can cause grain breakage, contamination, and compromised quality. Flexicon bulk material handling equipment prevents these issues, maintaining rice integrity and quality throughout processing.

**Overview:** Rice is the seed of swamp grass widely cultivated as a food source for many parts of the world. Worldwide, rice trails only corn in production. However, since a large portion of corn is grown for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the leading crop for human nutrition globally. Rice is used as an entrée or a side dish; it also has applications as a breakfast cereal and a dessert. Rice is an additive in some pet foods and multi-grain breads. Oil extracted from rice grains is used as a cooking oil and an ingredient. Rice is also the key ingredient used in the brewing of sake.

Worldwide, there are more than 40,000 varieties of rice, each of which can be classified as long-, medium- or short-grain rice. The primary difference in each rice is its cooking characteristics and, to a lesser extent, subtle flavor differences.

A series of processing steps are necessary to prepare harvested rice (referred to as "rough" or "paddy" rice) for consumption. The initial step is to separate the rice husk from the rice grain. This may be the only step in the progression of some rice as it creates "brown rice," which is valued as a health food product due to its high protein content. Otherwise, the rice is subjected to milling to remove the bran layer and then to polishing, where the surface of the rice is smoothed and given a shine by a series of rollers. After polishing, the rice is ready for packaging and delivery, either to a wholesaler or a processing facility.

## Characteristics and Challenges

Rice is free-flowing, granular and may be mildly abrasive. Most grades of rice have an [average bulk density of 45 lb/ft³](https://dynamicbulk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bulk-Material-Density-Property-Chart.pdf).

### Pneumatic Conveyance

If the rice is pneumatically conveyed into a processing system, the blower used to move it through the convey line must be sized to meet the system's demands. Rice can be degradable, so care must be taken to maintain an air-line velocity that does not damage it.

### Bulk Bag Discharging

If the rice arrives at the processing facility in bulk bags, the frames used to discharge the bags should be equipped with additional accessories designed to reduce the manpower and effort necessary to transfer the rice from the bulk bag into downstream equipment. These devices can elongate and stretch the bags, promoting a better flow and removing any pockets of rice cornered. Some bag-activating devices also serve as a dust-tight seal between the bulk bag and the receiving hopper.

### Dust Control and Collection

As the rice from the connected bulk bag fills the receiving hopper beneath it, the air inside the hopper is forced out. Airborne dust particles can escape into the surrounding atmosphere unless this air passes through a filter. A dust collector mounted on the discharger frame will contain the dust inside the conveyance system, lowering the risk of potentially dangerous dusting and reducing the time necessary to perform the routine cleaning and sanitation typically required in most food processing environments.

### Feed Hoppers

Feed hoppers should be designed with proper geometry and may need to incorporate devices such as vibrators to promote flow. If the rice is packaged in smaller bags, a bag dumping station with a dust hood and filtration devices may be sufficient to support the manual unloading of the material in hoppers. A bag compactor connected to the dumping station will permit operators to pass empty bags directly to a compactor, creating a dust-contained disposal method for the empty bags. A hopper screen above the receiving vessel will help to prevent the introduction of foreign objects and protect the operators from potentially dangerous conveying equipment.

### Flexible Screw Conveyance

If a flexible screw is being used to convey the rice, it is vital to use a screw that matches the rice's characteristics and other application requirements. Generally, a round screw is necessary for moving rice up an incline.

### Additional Precautions

As an additional precaution, some facilities use magnets and metal detectors to remove tramp metal objects concealed in the rice during processing.

### Bulk Bag Loading

If your rice application involves loading the rice into bulk bags, the bag capacity will be maximized by using a vibratory densification deck to level the rice as it fills the bag and by applying load cells to achieve the desired weight. Seals and other dust containment devices will ensure a dust-tight operation.
