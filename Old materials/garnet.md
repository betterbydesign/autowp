## Garnet

**Material page name:** Garnet

**Hero Description:** Garnet is a dense, abrasive mineral used in waterjet cutting and sandblasting. Flexicon bulk material handling equipment is essential to effectively handle garnet's weight and abrasive nature.

**Overview:** Garnet is commonly associated with a red-hued birthstone for the month of January. However, [garnet occurs in several other colors and has many industrial applications](https://geology.com/minerals/garnet.shtml), including waterjet cutting, abrasive blasting media, water filtration granules, and abrasive powders. Garnet is generally found inside of metamorphic rock, which is formed under both high temperatures and pressure, which causes the isometric garnet crystals to form. Various types of garnet can be found in many regions, most of them in the Southern Hemisphere; however, its production as an abrasive occurs mainly in India, China, Australia and the United States. On the cost per karat spectrum, spessartite garnet tends to be the most expensive, while other types of garnet, such as [almandine, pyrope and rhodolite, have a lower cost per karat](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/Garnet-facts-geology-of-the-world.html).

Garnet is ideal for cutting and blasting, as the process of crushing it causes the garnet to break into angular pieces with sharp edges. Garnet has a high level of hardness (7.5 to 8.5 out of 10) on the MOHS scale and is chemically inert, meaning it will not interact with the material the garnet is being used to cut or blast. There are generally two types of abrasive garnet: blasting grade and waterjet grade. All pieces which are larger than 60 mesh (250 micrometers) are normally used for sand blasting. The pieces between 60 mesh (250 micrometers) and 200 mesh (74 micrometers) are normally used for waterjet cutting. The remaining garnet pieces that are finer than 200 mesh (74 micrometers) are used for glass polishing and lapping. Regardless of the application, [the larger grain sizes are used for faster work, and the smaller ones are used for finer finishes](https://reade.com/product/garnet-grain-sand-powder/).

**Characteristics and Challenges:** Equipment selection is paramount to ensure the longevity of the system. A garnet conveying system must be rugged enough to withstand the impact of the material on the interior surfaces and moving parts of the conveying line and equipment. With an average bulk density of 150 lbs/cu ft (2,406 kg/mÂ³), garnet is generally free-flowing. Entry of garnet particles into gears, valves or other moving parts could result in equipment damage.

### Handling Garnet to Prevent Degradation

In some applications, the shape and purity of the garnet are important, so care must be taken to avoid degradation while handling it. Coarser particles of garnet tend to interlock, potentially impeding their flow into downstream processing equipment. Wet garnet will jam and otherwise strain conveying systems, so the material should remain as dry as possible during transportation and storage to a cutting or abrasive application.

### Bulk Bag Discharge Systems

If the garnet arrives at the processing facility in bulk bags, the frames used to discharge the bags should ideally be equipped with additional accessories to completely empty the garnet from the bag. These include features such as spring-loaded frames that will elongate and stretch the bags, making them rigid and removing any pockets of garnet cornered in the bags. Some of these bag-activating devices also serve as a dust seal between the bulk bag and the receiving hopper.

### Dust Suppression and Material Recovery

After the bulk bag has been connected to the receiving hopper and the garnet begins to flow, the air inside the hopper is displaced. Dust suppression during the dumping and de-gassing of the bulk bags can be achieved by means of a high-volume fan drawing dust onto cartridge filters. This arrangement can also act as a vacuum that evacuates the bulk bags post-discharge, eliminating the potential dusting that could occur when the bags are removed and folded prior to storage or disposal. Dust accumulated on the cartridge filters can be dislodged by automatic reverse-pulse blasts of air that return the dust to the receiving hopper, reducing material waste and plant contamination.

### Manual Feeding of Garnet

If the garnet is being fed into the processing system manually from handheld bags, a bag-breaking station with a dust hood, filtration devices and pneumatic reverse-pulse cleaner is the recommended solution. A hopper screen above the receiving vessel will help to prevent the introduction of foreign objects and protect the operator from moving components inside the hopper.

### Flexible Screw Conveyors for Garnet

If a flexible screw or auger is being used to convey the garnet, it is important to use a screw that is matched to the garnet's flow characteristics, generally one with a round profile. Due to garnet's abrasiveness, a heavy-duty flexible screw is recommended.

### Bulk Bag Filling Systems

Should your garnet application require the loading of material into bulk bags, the bag capacity will be maximized by use of a vibratory densification deck to densify and level the garnet as it fills the bag and by automated controls that fill the bag by weight. Seals and other dust containment devices will ensure a dust-tight operation.
