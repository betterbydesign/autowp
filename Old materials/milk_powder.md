## Milk Powder

**Material page name:** Milk Powder

**Hero Description:** Milk powder is a hygroscopic material prone to clumping and dust generation during handling. Flexicon bulk material handling systems efficiently manage these challenges, ensuring safe, clump- and dust-free transport that meets food safety standards.

**Overview:** Milk powder is a milk product obtained by extracting water from milk. By removing moisture, the potential for microbial growth is reduced. As a result, milk powder provides transportation, storage convenience, and shelf-life benefits not found in liquid milk. It is usually a lower-cost alternative to liquid milk and has many applications.

A range of milk powders is available, each with varying levels of protein, fat and water. These types include whole milk powder, nonfat dry milk powder and skimmed milk powder. Each milk powder has commonly used WMP, NFDM and SMP abbreviations, respectively. The defining characteristics of each milk powder are milkfat by weight on a milk-solids-not-fat (MSNF) basis, which ranges between 1.5% and 40% depending on the type of milk powder. The second characteristic is moisture, which ranges from 5% moisture by weight to less than 1%. NFDM and SMP are further defined by milk protein content. [SMP has a minimum milk protein content of 34%](https://www.thinkusadairy.org/products/milk-powders/milk-powder-categories/non-fat-dry-milk-and-skim-milk-powder#:~:text=The%20difference%20is%20that%20skimmed%20milk%20powder,the%20heat%20treatment%20used%20in%20their%20manufacture.), whereas NFDM has no standardized protein level.

WMP, NFDM and SMP milk powders are classified as ingredients according to the heat treatment used in their manufacture. This treatment determines the solubility of the milk powder and, thus, its selected application. These uses include blending it with pastry dough to make the dough crispier, as an egg substitute, as a freshness aid in baking breads, and in producing milk chocolate, ice cream and infant formula. Milk powder is also used in humanitarian relief efforts, is stored in emergency shelters and is carried by hikers and campers.

**Characteristics and Challenges:** While the low water content of milk powder eliminates much of the potential for microbial growth, most forms of milk powder still have a limited shelf life. WMP maintains a premium freshness level for approximately six months. Skim milk powder, which lacks the fat molecules found in WMP, has an [average shelf life of three years](https://usdec.files.cms-plus.com/pdfs/foodaid/smpstoragefactsheet.pdf).

### Hygienic Standards and Regulatory Requirements

Stringent hygienic conditions are required in most countries to handle milk powder. The 3-A Sanitary Standards Inc. has established criteria for manufacturing, fabricating, and installing milk powder and other dairy product processing systems in the United States. 3-A sanitary standards cover topics that include [equipment design standards that facilitate proper hygiene](https://www.betterengineering.com/3a-sanitary-standards-2/#:~:text=The%203%2DA%20Sanitary%20Standards%20set%20out%20specific%20requirements%20for,operations%20are%20safe%20and%20effective.), such as design concepts, product contact surface finish specifications and permissible materials that may be used to construct the equipment. Consultation with a qualified and experienced manufacturer of 3-A design and constructed equipment is recommended when choosing a system to convey milk powder.

### Handling and Processing Challenges

Milk powder is often highly processed and requires special treatment during handling. Highly fat-enriched milk powders may leave a product buildup in the convey line, which could affect the quality of the end product and will also create hygienic risks. Milk powders readily take up moisture from the air, leading to agglomerations in the convey line and a rapid loss of product quality. The [fat in milk powder can react with oxygen in the air](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8534860/) to give off flavors, especially at higher storage temperatures above 85°F (30°C).

### Bulk Density and Aeration Properties

Milk powder has an [average bulk density of 35 lb/ft](https://dynamicbulk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bulk-Material-Density-Property-Chart.pdf)³. It is aeratable, meaning air movement may cause the milk powder to take flight and settle as dust. Some milk powder specks will fluidize or take on the characteristics of a liquid. Milk powder dust is also potentially explosive. Experienced handlers of powdered milk have observed that bulk densities tend to change without notice as shipments of dry milk powder may arrive at the processing facility from many suppliers.

### Bulk Bag Handling Considerations

If the milk powder has been transported to the facility in bulk bags, care must be taken to ensure that the bag discharge frames are constructed to 3-A standards and that the bags can be emptied completely. Bag-activating devices that compress the bulk bag's sides and bottom corners generally promote a better flow. Complementary devices will also stretch the bags, elongating them to remove pockets that may retain milk powder. Some flow promotion devices can incorporate clamping features, providing an airtight seal between the bulk bag and the receiving hopper. This seal preserves product integrity and contains dust.

### Dust Management and Containment

As the milk powder fills a receiving hopper beneath the bulk bag, the air inside the vessel is forced out. Airborne dust particles can escape into the surrounding atmosphere unless this air passes through a filter. A dust collector mounted on the discharger frame will contain the milk powder inside the conveyance system. This lowers the risk of potentially dangerous dusting and reduces the time necessary to perform the routine cleaning and sanitation required in a 3-A environment.

### Material Flow and System Design

In addition to designing and building process vessels for sanitary purposes, other factors must also be considered to ensure proper material flow of milk powder to downstream processes, such as a conveyor. As fat and moisture content vary, so do the flow properties of different grades of milk powder. The geometries of storage hoppers and flow promotion devices, such as vibrators and mechanical agitators, must be considered and applied appropriately.

### Manual Bag Handling Solutions

If the milk powder is packaged in smaller bags, a bag-breaking station with a dust hood and remote dust collection cartridges is likely sufficient to support manual unloading. A hopper grate will protect operators from moving equipment components and prevent the introduction of foreign objects.

### Pneumatic Conveying Requirements

If the milk powder is being pneumatically conveyed into a processing system, the conveying air must be properly filtered to prevent the introduction of contaminants. Further, the blower used to move milk powder through the conveying line must be sized to meet the system's demands.

A dryer may be necessary in specific applications to remove moisture from the air and prevent the milk powder from agglomerating in the conveying line.

### Flexible Screw Conveyor Optimization

As previously described, milk powders have a wide MSNF range. As this can result in a wide variability of material flow and compression properties, when handling milk powders with a flexible screw conveyor, a range of spiral geometries must be available to optimize the performance of the conveyor. This will allow for the proper pairing of powder properties with equipment design.

### Bulk Bag Loading Optimization

Should your milk powder application feature material loading into bulk bags, the bag capacity will be maximized by using vibratory densification decks to de-aerate the milk powder as it fills the bag and by applying load cells to ensure the desired weight. Seals and other dust containment devices will ensure a dust-tight operation.
