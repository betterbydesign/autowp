## Talc

**Material page name:** Talc

**Hero Description:** Talc, a soft, powdery mineral used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and industrial applications, presents unique handling challenges due to its low bulk density and generation of airborne particles. Flexicon bulk material handling systems maintain product integrity, keeping talc dry and clump-free during transport.

**Overview:** Most people are familiar with the mineral talc. It can be crushed into a powder known as "talcum powder." This powder can absorb moisture, oils and odor, serve as a lubricant and produce an astringent effect on human skin. These properties make talc powder an essential ingredient in many baby powders, foot powders, first aid powders and various cosmetics. Talc is usually green, white, gray, brown or colorless. Talc is a translucent mineral with a pearly luster. [Talc is the softest known mineral and is assigned a hardness of 1](https://geology.com/minerals/talc.shtml#google_vignette) (compared to a diamond's hardness of 10) on the Mohs Hardness scale.

Talc has a variety of other uses as well. Of the total talc consumed during 2011 in the United States, 26% of the talc was used in the manufacturing of plastics, 17% of the talc consumed was used in the manufacturing of ceramic products such as bathroom fixtures, ceramic tile, pottery and dinnerware, while both the paint and the paper industries each consumed16% of the talc produced. Also, in 2011, about 7% of the talc consumed in the United States was used to make [cosmetics and antiperspirants](https://globexmining.com/documents/Metaluses_Talc.pdf).

More recently, talc has come under some scrutiny as a [possible carcinogen](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/talcum-powder-and-cancer.html#:~:text=IARC%20classifies%20talc%20as%20%E2%80%9Cprobably,key%20properties%20of%20a%20carcinogen.).

## Characteristics and Challenges

Talc is characterized by hydrophobic surface properties, chemical inertness and a slippery feeling. Although all talcs share the same basic properties --- inertness, softness, water repellency and an affinity for organic substances --- [each talc ore body has its features](https://ima-europe.eu/about-industrial-minerals/talc/), so no two talcs are quite the same.

### Semi-Free-Flowing Nature

Generally, talc is a semi-free-flowing powder that smears and tends to fluidize, meaning the fine talc particles take on the characteristics of a liquid. Talc powder is best kept as dry as possible. Once wet, talc in powder form becomes very slimy and is extremely hard to handle as a heavy precipitate.

### Emissions Screening

Emissions screening is a key component of successful talc conveying. Fabric filters are commonly used to control emissions during conveying, classifying, storage silo loading, and bagging operations.

### Air-Tight Connections and Flow Promotion

Airtight connections and flow-promotion devices on conveying equipment may be necessary. If the talc arrives at the processing facility in bulk bags, the frames used to discharge the bags should be equipped with additional accessories to empty the talc during the discharge process completely. This includes spring-loaded frames and bag-activating devices that stretch the bag during discharge. Some bag-activating devices will also serve as an airtight connection between the bulk bag discharger and the receiving hopper.

### Dust Control

A dust collector mounted on the discharger frame will help to keep talc dust from escaping into the facility. This not only helps safeguard worker health by reducing airborne particles but should also improve plant cleanliness and reduce the number of housekeeping efforts usually associated with the movement of talc.

### Manual Handling

If the talc is packaged in manual dump bags, a bag emptying station with a dust hood, filtration devices and a pneumatic pulse cleaner are likely sufficient to support the manual unloading of the material.

### Hopper Design and Geometry

Feed hoppers should be designed with proper geometry, and devices like vibrators may need to be incorporated to help densify this highly aerable material. A hopper screen above the receiving vessel will help protect the operators if the talc is manually dumped into a hopper equipped with agitating devices.

### Conveyance Equipment

Care should be taken when determining the types and placement of capacitive level sensors in the receiving hoppers when conveying talc. Evaluating the material and the system used to handle it is recommended. In some instances, vibrating forks and probes or rotating paddles are more reliable in sensing the levels of the talc in the vessel.

### Handling Techniques

Talc powder is best handled by the conveyance machinery gently so as not to become too aerated. If a flexible screw is being used to convey talc, a screw with a wider, flatter surface than the standard-sized screw is a required choice. If the talc is being pneumatically conveyed into a processing system, the blower used to move the airline must be sized to meet the system. If ambient or storage vessel moisture is an issue, an inline air dryer that is powerful enough to extract the moisture is an effective aid in maintaining the flow of talc.

### Bulk Bag Loading

If your talc application features bulk bag loading, load cells and vibratory densification decks will greatly maximize the capacity of the bulk bags.
