## Hemp

**Material page name:** Hemp

**Hero Description:** Hemp, widely used in textiles, food, and construction, requires bulk handling systems to manage its fibrous texture. Flexicon bulk material handling equipment offers efficient, clog-free transport and gentle handling to maintain the highest hemp product quality.

**Overview:** Industrial hemp is a strain of Cannabis Sativa, a renewable resource cultivated primarily for its fiber, flowers and seeds. One of the oldest known domesticated crops, it has been used for making paper, textiles and rope for thousands of years.

### Uses of Hemp

Today, hemp is used in a myriad of products. The seeds and flowers are incorporated into foods, beauty products and nutraceuticals as the fibrous stalk produces cordage, carpet, clothes, insulation, animal bedding, non-wovens, concrete, biodegradable packaging, biofuel and more.

### Genetic Distinctions

While sharing a common cannabis ancestry with marijuana, hemp contains less than 0.3% of the psychoactive agent THC found in marijuana. Similar in appearance, the plants differ in their genetic makeup, uses and cultivation methods.

### Historical Regulation

Despite these differences, however, hemp was included in many pieces of legislation introduced at the state and national level to regulate the cultivation and sale of all cannabis varieties. It was included in the 1970 Controlled Substances Act as a Schedule 1 drug.

### Legal Milestones

The 2018 Farm Bill, passed by the United States Congress and signed into law by President Trump, legalized hemp production in the United States as an agricultural commodity and removed it from the list of controlled substances.

### Hemp Plant Structure

The hemp plant has a woody core fiber known as "hurds," surrounded by a soft pith layer with a tough outer layer consisting of bast fibers. The commercial markets for bast fibers include specialty textiles, paper and composites. Hurds are used for garden mulch, animal bedding, and fuel. When mixed with other materials, hurds can be fashioned into concrete-like building materials, composites, and fiberglass alternatives used in the auto and aviation industries.

### Hemp Seed Applications

Hemp seeds are pressed to extract oil, cannabidiol, known as CBD, which is purported to have medicinal uses. Hemp seed oil is also used in paints, varnishes, personal care products, nutraceuticals and food supplements. The seeds can be ground into flour and used in animal feed.

**Characteristics and Challenges:** Consultation with an experienced material handling systems engineer is recommended when considering a hemp conveying solution. In powder form, hemp is generally 180 microns in diameter and has a bulk density between 12 to 18 lb/ft続 (192 to 288 kg/m続). Common challenges when conveying hemp powder include bridging and rat-holing of the material, resulting in poor or nonexistent material flow in the convey line. Traces of the oil remaining in the hemp powder can cause the material to pack or cake and leave a non-lubricating residue on the convey line.

### Hemp Seed Conveying

Hemp seeds are approximately 0.175 in. (4.45 mm) in diameter. These are free-flowing and can flood conveying lines. They are also friable and may require lower-speed, gentle conveying systems to avoid degradation.

### Hemp Stalks and Flowers

Hemp stalks and flowers have irregular shapes and bulk densities, generally falling from 10 to 12 lb/ft続 (160 to 192 kg/m続). Lightweight and compressible, they tend to interlock during shipment and storage and can be difficult to evacuate from IBCs (Intermediate Bulk Containers) with narrow openings. Care must be taken to ensure that the stalks are of the proper length and moisture content to prevent them from binding moving components or plug convey lines.

### Processing and Handling Standards

When hemp is used as a food or personal care additive, the equipment used to process it should meet all regional, national and international standards for food handling design, construction and operation.

### Pneumatic Conveying

If the hemp is pneumatically conveyed into a processing system, the blower used to move it through the airline must be sized to meet the system's demands.

### Flexible Screw Conveying

If a flexible screw is being used to convey hemp, a screw with a wider, flatter surface than the standard-sized screw is recommended.

### Bulk Bag Handling

A secure, dust-tight connection between the bag spout and the equipment inlet that creates a sealed system is recommended for unloading hemp from bulk bags. Equipment purpose-built for flow promotion should be applied to aid in fully evacuating hemp from the bag. These include spring-loaded frames that stretch the top of the bag upward as it empties and elongates, causing hemp to flow from the corners of the bag, and pneumatically-actuated flow promotion devices that massage the bag and direct non-free-flowing hemp into the bag spout. To prevent dust escape in the event of a leak and/or when incoming hemp displaces air, the sealed system can be vented to a dust collector that puts the entire system under vacuum. This provides the added benefit of collapsing empty bags before tie-off and removal, preventing dust generated when empty bags are flattened manually.

### Feed Hopper Design

Feed hoppers should be designed with proper geometry and may need to incorporate devices such as vibrators to aid in the flow of the hemp. A hopper screen above the receiving vessel will help protect the operators if the hemp is manually dumped into a hopper equipped with agitating devices.

### Bulk Bag Filling

When filling bulk bags with hemp, dust can be contained by making secure connections between the material feed source and the bulk bag filler inlet. The sealed system is vented to a filter sock or optional dust collection system to prevent displaced air and dust from entering the plant environment. Using vibratory densification decks will significantly maximize the capacity of the bulk bags during the filling process. At the same time, load cells and programmable gain-in-weight controls can greatly reduce cycle times and increase weighing accuracy.
