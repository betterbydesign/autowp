## Sodium Sulfate

**Material page name:** Sodium Sulfate

**Hero Description:** Sodium sulfate, a hygroscopic white crystalline compound used in detergents and glass manufacturing, requires specialized handling. Flexicon bulk material handling equipment maintains consistent flow, preventing moisture absorption for reliable, clump-free transport and storage.

**Overview:** First discovered in Austria, sodium sulfate was used in 18th-century Europe as a medicinal cure for various ailments. Since then, the compound has evolved through a series of uses. Sodium sulfate was an essential material in manufacturing various detergents and paper. However, changes in end-user applications and regulatory guidelines have reduced the role of sodium sulfate in those industries. Relatively inexpensive and practical as both a filling and leveling agent, sodium sulfate is now used to manufacture glass and textiles. Now, it finds new uses in part of the gold recovery process from electronic products.

Most sodium sulfate produced globally is from the natural mineral mirabilite, found mainly in Canadian, Russian and U.S. lake beds. However, sodium sulfate is a byproduct of various chemical processes, such as battery acid recycling or silica pigment refining. Technically a waste product, the [sodium sulfate from these processes](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/sodium-sulfate-statistics-and-information) is marketed for the same applications as naturally occurring sodium sulfate.

## Characteristics and Challenges

### Density and Abrasiveness 

Most grades of sodium sulfate have an [average bulk density of 85 lbs/ftÂ³](https://dynamicbulk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bulk-Material-Density-Property-Chart.pdf), making it a very dense material. Because sodium sulfate is abrasive, conveying equipment must be rugged enough to handle it.

### Flow and Hygroscopic Properties

Sodium sulfate is generally free-flowing and crystalline in form. It is also hygroscopic, meaning humidity and temperature may impact its flow.

### Pneumatic Conveying Considerations

If sodium sulfate is pneumatically conveyed into a processing system, the blower used to move it through the air must be sized to meet the system's demands. Sodium sulfate tends to absorb moisture from the air, which can cause excessive clumping. Additional devices may be required to reduce the humidity levels or draw moisture from the material before entering the conveyor.

### Bulk Bag Handling

If sodium sulfate is added to the process out of bulk bags, the frames used to discharge the bags may require additional accessories. The need for these devices may vary depending on the grade of sodium sulfate conveyed and the bag type. In areas of high humidity, additional equipment may be needed to serve as an air---and moisture-tight seal, protecting the sodium sulfate from airborne aerosols and other contaminants.

### Hopper Geometry and Flow Promotion

The geometry of the feed hoppers is another important aspect. To ensure proper flow of the sodium sulfate into the charging adaptor, devices such as vibrators or mechanical agitators may need to be incorporated to promote flow. A hopper screen above the receiving vessel will help protect the operators if the sodium sulfate is manually dumped into a hopper equipped with agitating devices.

### Flexible Screw Conveying

Due to Sodium Sulfate's granular or crystalline form and its free-flowing nature, a round screw design is commonly used for flexible screw conveying.

### Bulk Bag Filling Considerations

If your sodium sulfate application involves loading the material into bulk bags, the bag capacity will be maximized by using a vibratory densification deck to level the sodium sulfate as it fills the bag and applying load cells to attain the desired weight. Seals and other dust containment devices will ensure a dust-tight and moisture-tight operation.
