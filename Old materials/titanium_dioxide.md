## Titanium Dioxide

**Material page name:** Titanium Dioxide

**Hero Description:** Titanium dioxide, a fine white pigment essential for paints and coatings, requires specialized bulk handling equipment to prevent dust generation and ensure consistent flow. Flexicon equipment safeguards product integrity and enhances operational safety.

**Overview:** Titanium dioxide is a naturally occurring substance that results from the oxidation of the titanium element. Also called titanium IV oxide or titania, it is one of the whitest materials known. It is used in many industries to provide whiteness and opacity to paints, plastics, papers, inks, foods, and cosmetics. It is highly refractory, often used in cosmetics to reflect light away from the skin or in sunblock for the same purpose. Other industries use its refractory nature in protective coatings for automobile and marine parts and in optical mirrors. Titanium dioxide is also used in building and construction materials.

Due to its many uses, titanium dioxide is one of the most widely used chemicals worldwide for industrial and other purposes. It accounts for 70% of the total production volume of pigments worldwide.

In appearance, titanium dioxide is a crystalline white powder with a [bulk density of 48 lb/ft³ (0.77 g/cc)](https://hapman.com/resources-knowledge/tools/bulk-density-guide/).

## Characteristics and Challenges

Titanium Dioxide is an odorless, highly cohesive, and adhesive white powder containing agglomerated lumps that tend to coat steel surfaces. It is moderately abrasive and non-free-flowing and tends to pack, cake and smear.

### Safety Concerns

TiO₂ is incompatible with strong oxidizers and strong acids. Violent or incandescent reactions may occur with metals (fused and highly electropositive) such as aluminum, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc and lithium.

Prolonged exposure to titanium dioxide should be avoided as a safety concern. Inhaling the dust may cause respiratory problems, and repeated contact may dry the skin. Some evidence suggests that [it is a carcinogen](https://www.tdma.info/safety/debunking-the-myths-of-titanium-dioxide-and-cancer/).

### Storage Recommendations

Titanium dioxide should be stored in a clean, dry space away from exposure to high temperatures, open flames, and intensely aromatic chemicals.

### Handling Challenges

Titanium dioxide is difficult to handle; it cakes and packs easily. As a result, fines tend to form deposits in the conveying line. It is insoluble in water and solvents. Manufacturers must remain vigilant to prevent spills and the cleanup that would follow. With appropriate filtration, intensive and costly dry vacuuming is preferred for removing titanium dioxide surface dust and cleaning spills.

### Bulk Bag Handling

If the titanium dioxide arrives at the processing facility in bulk bags, the frames used to discharge the bags should be equipped with additional accessories to reduce the need for operator intervention when emptying the titanium dioxide from the bag. This includes features like spring-loaded frames that will elongate and stretch the bags as they empty and lighten, making them rigid and removing any pockets of titanium dioxide cornered in them. Bag-activating devices are usually practical in dislodging collections of titanium dioxide, promoting a better flow. Some bag-activating devices also serve as an airtight seal between the bulk bag and the receiving hopper.

### Dust Control and Air Displacement

After the bulk bag has been connected to the receiving hopper and the titanium dioxide begins to flow, the air inside the hopper is forced out. Unless this displaced air passes through a filter, airborne dust particles can escape into the surrounding atmosphere, creating a potentially hazardous situation. A dust collector mounted on the discharger frame will contain the titanium dioxide inside the conveyance system. Titanium dioxide dust trapped in the filter media can be returned to the receiving hopper by a pneumatic pulse through the filter.

### Manual Bag-Handling Solutions

If titanium dioxide is added to the processing stream from smaller (>50 lb./22.76 kg.) bags, a bag-breaking station with a dust hood, filtration devices, and a pneumatic pulse cleaner are recommended to support manual unloading. If empty bag disposal is an issue, a dust-tight bag compacting system may be necessary.

### Hopper Design and Flow Management

With its poor flow characteristics, titanium dioxide will tend to "rat hole" or bridge in hoppers, completely blocking the flow of the material and causing a shutdown. At the same time, it is removed, elevating the risk of dusting or spillage. Feed hoppers should be designed with proper geometry. They may need to incorporate devices such as air fluidizers or vibrators to dislodge titanium dioxide from hopper walls or mechanical agitators to promote flow.

### Conveying with Flexible Screws

If a flexible screw is being used to convey the material, it is vital to use a screw that matches titanium dioxide's characteristics and other application requirements. Generally, a screw with a wider, flatter surface than the standard-sized screw is necessary for this type of material.

### Bulk Bag Loading

Should your titanium dioxide application involve loading the material into bulk bags, the bag capacity will be maximized by using a vibratory densification deck to level the titanium dioxide as it fills the bag and load cells to attain the desired weight. Seals and other dust-containment devices will ensure a dust-tight operation.
