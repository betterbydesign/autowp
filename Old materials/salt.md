## Salt

**Material page name:** Salt

**Hero Description:** Salt, used in food processing and industrial applications, is abrasive and corrosive, demanding specialized equipment for safe handling. Flexicon bulk material handling equipment is designed with corrosion-resistant materials, ensuring long-term durability and protection for salt transport and storage.

**Overview:** Salt is nearly as old as humankind itself. Its use dates back to some of the earliest recorded periods of history and its preservative and restorative benefits have long been recognized. Salt is a versatile compound with multiple applications in the food, chemical and construction industries. Most salt is sold for industrial use, where it has great commercial value as a [necessary ingredient in many manufacturing processes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK254244/).

There are two general forms of salt: unrefined and refined. The former category mainly consists of natural sea salts processed using roasting or evaporation techniques. These salts are most commonly used as bathing additives and cosmetics.

Refined salt is more widely used presently and is mainly sodium chloride. Food-grade salt accounts for only a small part of salt production. The majority is sold for industrial use. A few common examples include the production of pulp and paper, setting dyes in textiles and fabrics, and making soaps and detergents.

Salt is used in cold weather climes in the United States and Canada to de-ice snowy, slushy or icy road and pavement surfaces. It is also used as a "softener," removing elements such as calcium and magnesium from tap water supplies.

## Characteristics and Challenges

### Salt Properties

Salt is generally free-flowing and has a large surface area. Although most salt is granular and crystalline, it is also available in larger particle sizes, such as rock salt. It may also be micronized into smaller sizes, such as flour salt. Salt is hygroscopic, meaning that humidity and temperature may impact its flow.

### Flow Agents and Equipment Durability

Salt may be introduced with flow agents to help it flow freely and reduce the possibility of conveying issues. Salt is both abrasive and corrosive, so equipment must withstand prolonged exposure.

### Pneumatic Conveying Considerations

If salt is pneumatically conveyed into a processing system, the blower used to move it through the air must be sized to meet the system's demands. Salt tends to absorb moisture from the air, which can cause excessive clumping. Additional devices may be required to reduce the humidity levels or draw moisture from the salt before entering the conveyor.

### Material Protection and Stainless Steel Use

High air velocity in some pneumatic systems may damage salt granules. Because salt is corrosive, 316L-grade stainless steel is usually recommended.

### Bulk Bag Discharge and Conveying

If the salt arrives at the processing facility in large bulk bags, the frames used to discharge the bags may require additional accessories. The need for these devices may vary based on the grade of salt being conveyed, the quality of the bulk bags, and how well or poorly the salt was packaged. Due to salt's granular or crystalline form and its free-flowing nature, a round screw design is commonly used for flexible screw conveying.

### Feed Hopper Geometry and Flow Promotion

Another important aspect is the geometry of the feed hoppers. To prevent errors in conveyor charging, devices such as vibrators or mechanical agitators may need to be incorporated to promote flow. A hopper screen above the receiving vessel will help protect the operators if the salt is manually dumped into a hopper equipped with agitating devices.
