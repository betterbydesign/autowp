## Sugar

**Material page name:** Sugar

**Hero Description:** Sugar, available in granular or powdered forms, is susceptible to caramelization and explosion risks when suspended in air. Flexicon bulk material handling equipment ensures hygienic, efficient conveying to prevent contamination, maintain quality, and mitigate safety hazards.

**Overview:** Sugar is a mainstay in baking, candy, and confectionery production and is used as a sweetener by the food and beverage industries. Sucrose is table sugar, granular in appearance, and is the most popular of the various sugars for flavoring and for the properties (such as mouth feel, preservation, and texture) it adds to beverages and food. Powdered or confectionery sugar, as the name implies, has a powdery texture.

Sugar is a carbohydrate found in every fruit and vegetable. Once photosynthesis creates sugar, plants can change sugar to starch and starch to various sugars for storage. Sugar cane and sugar beet plants contain sucrose in large quantities, and that's why they are used as commercial sources of sugar. A stalk of the cane plant contains about 14% sugar. [Sugar beets contain about 16% sugar](https://www.sugar.org/wp-content/uploads/Toolkit_health_professionals.pdf).

Extracting sugar typically involves a continuous process in one facility. The plants are washed, sliced and soaked in hot water, creating a sugary juice. A series of steps --- purification, filtration, concentration, and drying --- completes the procedure. Raw sugar is an intermediate product in sugar production. Produced at a sugar mill, it is a tan, coarse, granulated product obtained from the evaporation of clarified sugar juice. The raw sugar producer [ships this product to a refinery for final processing](https://www.chefsteps.com/ingredients/sugar).

Sugar is used in non-food applications such as pharmaceuticals (solubility and coating), wound healing, fermentation products, organic cleaning products, glue and concrete bonding agents.

## Characteristics and Challenges

### Granular Sugar

Granular sugar is free-flowing, hygroscopic, agglomerates, mildly abrasive, and friable (meaning it can be reduced to smaller pieces without much effort). To avoid caramelization, it should be handled without excessive heat.

### Powdered Sugar

Powdered sugar is also hygroscopic but non-free-flowing, heat sensitive and aeratable (potentially affecting handling characteristics). This means that flow promotion devices are often required when conveying sugar.

### Safety and Efficiency

Faulty conveying of sugar in the manufacturing and/or packaging processes will not only eat away at production efficiency through unnecessary downtime, cleaning, maintenance and product loss, but it can also be dangerous.

Sugar dust can be highly explosive when suspended in air. [In 2008, an explosion and fire at a Georgia (USA) sugar refinery killed over a dozen workers](https://www.csb.gov/imperial-sugar-company-dust-explosion-and-fire/), and the cause was inadequately vented sugar dust. The US Occupational Safety & Health Administration has classified [sugar handling as high-risk](https://www.osha.gov/combustible-dust), and the US National Fire Protection Association has adopted new regulations concerning explosion protection for sugar-handling equipment.

### Handling and Conveying

If the sugar is being pneumatically conveyed into a processing system, the blower used to move the airline must be sized to meet the system's demands. Due to the hygroscopic nature of sugar, it absorbs moisture from the air. If this problem causes excessive clumping, additional devices may be required to reduce the humidity levels or draw moisture from the sugar before entering the conveyor. In the same method, air cooling or heating devices could be employed to moderate the temperature of the sugar during the conveying process.

### Bulk Handling Accessories

If the sugar arrives at the processing facility in large bulk bags, the frames used to discharge the bags usually require additional accessories to empty the bags and prevent any fine sugar dust particles from escaping into the surrounding atmosphere. If the sugar is packaged in smaller (>50 lb) bags, a bag-emptying station with a dust hood, filtration devices and a pneumatic pulse cleaner may be sufficient to support the manual unloading of the material.

### Flow Promotion

Some powdered sugars will tend to agglomerate, "rat hole" or bridge in hoppers, interrupting the flow of the material. Feed hoppers should be designed with proper geometry and may need to incorporate devices such as air fluidizers, vibrators or mechanical agitators to promote flow. A hopper screen above the receiving vessel will help protect the operators if the sugar is being manually dumped into a hopper equipped with agitating devices.

### Flexible Screw Conveying

If a flexible screw is being used to convey the sugar, it is vital to use a screw that matches the sugar's characteristics and other application requirements. Generally, a screw with a wider, flatter surface is necessary for moving sugar up an incline.
