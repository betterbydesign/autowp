## Nuts

**Material page name:** Nuts

**Hero Description:** Nuts like almonds, cashews, and walnuts require careful handling to prevent breakage, bruising, and contamination from oil residue. Flexicon bulk handling systems convey nuts efficiently, ensuring clump-free transfer and preserved integrity, appearance, and quality.

**Overview:** Long regarded by the general public as potentially unhealthy, tree nuts (including almonds, pecans and walnuts) have gained a new status as a health food. Many studies have cited the benefits of eating almonds, pecans, walnuts, and other tree nuts due to the unsaturated fats they contain. These are thought to [prevent blood clots and erratic heart rhythms](https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/nuts-for-the-heart/), among other benefits.

Production of almonds, pecans, walnuts and other tree nuts in the United States has increased significantly in the past 35 years. Beginning in 1970, when production of almonds, pecans, walnuts and other tree nuts was approximately 305 million pounds (138.3 million kg), U.S almonds, pecans, walnuts and other tree nuts production has grown to over 2 billion pounds (907 million kg) by 2005. Almonds, pecans and walnuts account for most of the United States' tree nut production.

Year-over-year tree nut production levels fluctuate. Weather is one factor, but almond, pecan, walnut, and other nut trees tend to vary in crop yields, restoring their nutrient reserves by producing fewer nuts one year after yielding a much larger crop.

**Characteristics and Challenges:** Most almonds, pecans, walnuts and other tree nuts have an [average bulk density of 29-33 lb/ft³ (465 kg/M³)](https://www.anval.net/Downloads/Bulk%20Density%20Chart.pdf).

### Preparation Process

The preparation of almonds, pecans, walnuts and other tree nuts is a labor-intensive and costly process. Clean nut "meats" usually comprise about 20 percent of the field weight harvested from orchards. The remainders--twigs, leaves, soil, and in some cases, the hulls--are usually unfit for further processing and must be removed early on.

### Shape and Texture Considerations

The shape and texture of almonds, pecans, walnuts and other tree nuts is crucial when presenting them to consumers. As a result, these products must be handled gently between the orchard and the packaging process.

### Oil Residue Concerns

All tree nuts have a high oil content. When pushed through a conveying system, they will leave a residue that may contaminate the vessels, making a clean-out between load changeovers necessary.

### Pasteurization Requirements

In the United States, several outbreaks of human salmonellosis associated with raw almonds and detentions of other tree nuts suspected of contamination resulted in mandatory pasteurization rules. This means an additional step in the handling process and an increased risk of damage to the shape and texture of almonds, pecans, walnuts and other tree nuts.

### Gentle Handling to Preserve Quality

Gentle, low-speed conveying of these materials between any two points is the best way to prevent them from damage or degradation.

### Pneumatic Conveying Considerations

If the almonds, pecans, walnuts and other tree nuts are being pneumatically conveyed into a processing system, the blower used to move them through the convey line must be sized to meet the system. When conveying whole nuts, care must be taken to maintain an airline velocity that does not result in an impact forceful enough to cause damage to them. For ground and mixed nuts, preventing particle segregation during this process is important.

### Abrasiveness of Tree Nuts

Almonds, pecans, walnuts and other tree nuts are usually abrasive, either in full nut or ground form. This means the equipment used to convey them must withstand the potential for abrasion.

### Bulk Bag Handling

If the tree nuts arrive at the processing facility in bulk bags (either as whole nuts or in some pre-processed form, including flour or meal), the frames used to discharge these bags should ideally be equipped with additional accessories to empty the material from the bag completely. This includes "periscoping" unloader frames that stretch the bags--making them rigid and removing any accumulated material.

### Bag-Activating Devices

Activating devices positioned on the discharger frame closer to the bag spout will promote a better material flow and help ensure the complete evacuation of the almonds, pecans, walnuts and other tree nuts from the bags. Some bag-activating devices also serve as a dust-tight seal between the bulk bag and the receiving hopper.

### Dust Containment

After the bulk bag has been connected to the receiving hopper and the material begins to flow, the air inside the hopper is forced out. Airborne dust particles can escape into the surrounding atmosphere unless this air passes through a filter. A dust collector mounted on the discharger frame will contain this dust inside the conveyance system.

### Routine Cleaning Requirements

A pneumatic pulse through the filter can remove the dust collected after the bag has been completely emptied. This reduces the time necessary to perform the routine cleaning and sanitation typically required in most food processing environments.

### Flow Challenges for Processed Nuts

In whole form, almonds, pecans, walnuts and other tree nuts are generally free-flowing and will pass through most processing equipment without the need for flow promotion devices. On the other hand, sliced or ground almonds, pecans, walnuts and other tree nuts tend to interlock in hoppers, impeding flow into downstream processing equipment. To promote a better flow, the feed hoppers may need to incorporate devices such as mechanical agitators or vibrators.

### Manually Unloading in Small Batches

Many orchards prefer shipping whole tree nuts in boxes of 50 lb (23 kg). A dumping station with a dust hood, filtration devices and a pneumatic pulse cleaner is the recommended solution to support the manual unloading of the material.

### Protection Against Foreign Objects

A hopper screen above the receiving vessel will help prevent the introduction of foreign objects and protect the operators if the nuts are being manually dumped into a hopper equipped with agitating devices.

### Flexible Screw Conveying Options

If a flexible screw is being used to convey the almonds, pecans, walnuts and other tree nuts, it is vital to use a screw that matches the nuts' application requirements. Generally, a screw with a wider and rounder profile will be effective in moving material with the characteristics of tree nuts from the hopper to a filling machine undamaged and with no separation of blended products. A wider, flatter spiral is usually the best chopped or ground nuts option.

### Optimized Bulk Bag Loading

Should your almonds, pecans, walnuts and other tree nuts require loading into bulk bags, the bag capacity will be maximized by using a vibratory densification deck to level the nuts as they fill the bag and load cells to achieve the desired weight. Seals and other dust containment devices will ensure a dust-tight operation.
