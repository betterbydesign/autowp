## Grains

**Material page name:** Grains

**Hero Description:** Grains like wheat, barley, and oats are delicate and prone to breakage during handling, which can impact quality and value. Flexicon bulk material handling equipment ensures smooth transport and gentle handling for minimal product loss.

**Overview:** Grain is the harvested seed of grasses such as wheat, oats, rice, and corn. Other important grains include sorghum, millet, rye, and barley. Also called cereal, grain is humankind's most important staple food, which is a food that can be eaten fresh or stored long-term for later use. Rice, corn, and wheat are the [most common staple foods on Earth](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/food-staple/).

Almost half of the grain grown worldwide is harvested for people to eat directly, as humans get an average of 48 percent of their calories, or food energy, from grain. A third of the world's grain supply is fed to animals. Most domestic animals, from livestock to pets, are fed food rich in grain and grain products. Grain is also used to manufacture cooking oils, cosmetics, and alcohols.

### Grain in Global Production and Economics

The rest of the world's grain supply is used to manufacture industrial products and fuels. Biodiesel is a fuel used for vehicles. One type of biodiesel is ethanol, which can be made from corn. Strong demand for ethanol production has resulted in higher corn prices and increased corn plantings.

Grain is a major component of most national economies worldwide. In the U.S., more than 90 million acres (36 million hectares) of land are planted to corn. Wheat trails only corn in grain plantings, with 63 million acres (25 million hectares) of U.S. land used to grow this grain. Grain remains the world's largest food yield, with more than [2.3 billion metric tons produced annually](https://www.routledge.com/Cereal-Grains-Properties-Processing-and-Nutritional-Attributes/Serna-Saldivar/p/book/9781439815601).

### Grain Handling Facilities

Grain handling facilities include grain elevators, feed mills, flour mills, rice mills, dust pelletizing plants, dry corn mills, facilities with soybean flaking operations, and facilities with dry grinding operations of soy cake. These facilities may receive, handle, store, process and ship bulk raw agricultural commodities such as (but not limited to) corn, wheat, oats, barley, sunflower seeds, and soybeans.

**Characteristics and Challenges:**

### The Risk of Grain Dust Explosions

Grain dust is the leading cause of explosions in grain handling. These explosions are often severe, involving loss of life and substantial property damage. Grain dust is highly combustible and can burn or explode if enough becomes airborne or accumulates on a surface and finds an ignition source. OSHA standards require that grain dust and ignition sources be controlled in grain handling facilities to prevent these [potentially deadly explosions](https://www.osha.gov/grain-handling).

### Quality Issues Due to Grain Breakage

Grain is commonly marketed in whole grain form and is considered inferior if broken. Breakage may occur from fissures caused by excessive drying/weathering conditions in the field or during handling. It reduces quality by reducing acceptability and increasing susceptibility to infestation during storage. It also [contributes to weight loss, affecting milling yield](https://www.fao.org/4/t1838e/t1838e0h.htm).

### Handling and Conveying Considerations

Consult an experienced material handling systems engineer when considering a grain conveying solution. Most grain types will have irregular shapes, and bulk shipments usually contain fines. One problem that may be encountered when grain is put in motion is flooding, which could result in expensive and time-consuming spillage cleanup efforts. Other problems, such as bridging, rat-holing, and convey-line equipment wear, can significantly reduce processing efficiencies and cause extensive production line shutdowns.

### Managing Aeration and Dusting

Grain fines are also aeratable, meaning the particles can become airborne and escape into the surrounding atmosphere. This dusting can create highly hazardous conditions. If the grain is being pneumatically conveyed into a processing system, the blower used to move grain through the airline must be sized to meet the system's demands. The pipes carrying the grain may need grounding to prevent a static electricity shock. Potential plugging problems must also be considered. Some grain plugs will disperse on their own if no additional grain enters the convey line, but others may require manual cleaning to remove them.

### Gentle Handling of Grain

Grain is best handled gently so as not to create fines. Slower speeds are recommended to reduce the risk of damaging the grain.

### Recommendations for Bulk Bag Unloading

A secure, dust-tight connection between the bag spout and the equipment inlet is recommended when unloading grain from bulk bags. Flow-promotion mechanisms should be applied to aid in the full evacuation of grain from the bag. These include spring-loaded frames that stretch the top of the bag upward as it empties and elongates, causing the grain to flow from the corners of the bag, and pneumatically-actuated flow promotion devices that massage the bag and direct non-free-flowing grain into the bag spout.

### Preventing Dust Escape

To prevent dust escape in the event of a leak and/or when incoming grain displaces air, the sealed system can be vented to a dust collector that vacuums the entire system. This provides the added benefit of collapsing empty bags before tie-off and removal, preventing dust generation when empty bags are manually flattened.

### Design Considerations for Feed Hoppers

Feed hoppers should be designed with proper geometry and may need to incorporate accessories such as vibrators to aid in the densifying of the grain. A hopper screen above the receiving vessel will help protect the operators if the grain is manually dumped into a hopper equipped with agitating devices.

### Filling and Unloading Bulk Bags

Secure connections between the material feed source and the bulk bag filler inlet can contain dust when filling bulk bags with grain. The sealed system is vented to a filter sock or optional dust collection system to prevent displaced air and dust from entering the plant environment. Using load cells and vibratory densification decks will maximize the capacity of the bulk bags during the filling process.
