## Hydrated Lime

**Material page name:** Hydrated Lime

**Hero Description:** Hydrated lime, a fine powder used in water treatment and construction, has a natural tendency to absorb moisture and clump together. Flexicon's bulk handling equipment ensures consistent transport flow to minimize costly downtime.

**Overview:** Hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide) is a dry, colorless crystalline powder manufactured by treating calcium oxide (quicklime) with water in a process called "slaking." Also known as slack lime, builders lime or pickling lime, hydrated lime produces mortars, plasters, cements, paints, hard rubber products, petrochemicals, and leather tanning.

Hydrated lime, a mild alkali, has recently been used in environmental applications. Here, it [removes acid gases from coal-fired energy plants, cement mills, glassmakers and incinerators](https://www.lime.org/lime-basics/uses-of-lime/enviromental/flue-gas-desulfurization/#:~:text=Lime%20is%20used%20to%20remove,and%20requires%20less%20capital%20equipment.).

However, the largest single use of hydrated lime remains in steel manufacturing, where it is used to remove impurities. Hydrated lime is also used to produce other metals. In construction, hydrated lime is used in soil stabilization for roads, earthen dams, airfields, and building foundations. Hydrated lime can be used to [raise the pH of acidic soils](https://www.pubs.ext.vt.edu/452/452-510/452-510.html#:~:text=it%20forms%20clumps.-,Hydrated%20or%20slaked%20lime,of%20100%20(Table%202).). This is also referred to as soil "sweetening."

**Characteristics and Challenges:** Hydrated lime requires care during handling to prevent it from escaping into the surrounding atmosphere and also to avert contamination of the hydrated line from any airborne particles. Caution should be exercised to shield the hydrated lime from moisture or from contaminants containing moisture, which may trigger a chemical reaction that results in unexpected heat generation.

### Moisture Considerations

Caution should be exercised to shield the material from moisture or contaminants containing moisture, as hydrated lime is exothermic. At the same time, priority should be given to efforts for the protection of operators and other handlers of hydrated lime, as depending on the grade of material, hydrated lime is usually given an MSDS health (H) ranking of between 1 and 3 (progressively indicating a higher level of hazard) for its corrosive effects on the skin and eyes. Severe overexposure to hydrated lime by inhalation can produce lung damage, choking, unconsciousness or death. Because of these conditions, an airtight connection from the storage vessels to the processing equipment is strongly recommended.

### Variations and Handling Challenges

Experienced handlers of hydrated lime have observed that no two samples are exactly alike. On average, hydrated lime has a bulk density of 40 lb/ftÂ³ and is a soft and somewhat sluggish powder that tends to pack or smear. In some cases, however, the hydrated lime will do neither; instead, it may contain abrasive crystals. Hydrated lime has been known to "rat hole" or bridge in silos, bulk bags and feeder hoppers, stick to the sides of containers, flood while being fed into conveyors and build up inside the convey lines. Hydrated limes with the same bulk densities often have different characteristics. These variations and other features usually necessitate versatile handling equipment to move it successfully, and consultation with an expert is necessary before deciding on a suitable solution.

### Bulk Bag Handling

If the hydrated lime arrives at the processing facility in bulk bags, the frames used to discharge the bags should be equipped with additional accessories to eliminate agglomerations and completely empty the hydrated lime from the bag. This includes features such as spring-loaded frames that stretch the bags as they empty and lighten, making them rigid and removing any pockets of hydrated lime cornered in the bags. Bag-activating devices are usually effective in agitating the hydrated lime, dislodging collections of hydrated lime closer to the bag spout, and promoting a better flow. Some bag-activating devices also serve as an airtight seal between the bulk bag and the receiving hopper.

### Hopper and Conveying Line Design

The hoppers between the discharge bags and the conveying line should be designed with proper geometry. They may need to incorporate vibrators or air fluidizers to remove hydrated lime from hopper walls and mechanical agitators to promote flow.

### Smaller Bag Handling

If the hydrated lime is packaged in smaller bags, a bag-breaking station with a dust hood, filtration devices and a reverse pulse jet that pneumatically cleans the filter media, blowing the trapped dust back into the receiving hopper, is likely sufficient to support the manual unloading of the material. A hopper screen above the receiving vessel will help protect the operators if the hydrated lime is manually dumped into a hopper equipped with agitating devices.

### Pneumatic Conveying

If the hydrated lime is being pneumatically conveyed into a processing system, the blower used to move the airline must be sized to meet the system's demands. The pneumatic conveying line for hydrated lime should be as short as possible. The number of bends in the line should be kept to a minimum. The velocity of the conveying line should be reduced if the hydrated lime begins to build up inside the line. If a flexible screw is being used to convey hydrated lime, a screw with a wider, flatter surface than the standard-sized screw is a safer choice. A beveled edge screw is usually an effective choice to eliminate the buildup of hydrated lime on the inner wall of the conveying tube. Due to the sticky nature of hydrated lime, a higher-rated horsepower motor may be required.

### Bulk Bag Loading

Should your hydrated lime application feature bulk bag loading, using load cells and vibratory densification decks will significantly maximize the capacity of the bulk bags.
