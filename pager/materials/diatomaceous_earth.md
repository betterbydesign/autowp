## Diatomaceous Earth

**Material page name:** Diatomaceous Earth

**Hero Description:** Diatomaceous earth is a fine, silty powder derived from the fossilized remains of diatoms, microscopic sea creatures. Flexicon bulk material handling equipment is engineered to transport, store, and process diatomaceous earth efficiently and safely throughout your operation.

**Overview:** Also known as fossil flour or CELITEÂ®, diatomaceous earth is a versatile, naturally occurring sedimentary rock pulverized into a loose powder. It has diverse commercial and industrial uses ranging from pool filters and toothpaste abrasives to polishing compounds. Historically, diatomaceous earth has been a key ingredient in dynamite, stabilizing nitroglycerin. Food grade diatomaceous earth also finds use as a livestock feed supplement, grain preservative, odor control agent, blood clotting element, and insecticide, with some applications promoting its use as a human health additive.

**Characteristics and Challenges:** Diatomaceous earth is a crystalline silicate with an average bulk density near 16 lb/cu ft. It can appear in multiple physical forms at processing facilities, including packable pellets, abrasive particles, or finely ground powder that may be aeratable or semi-free flowing. These varying forms require specialized handling to maintain consistent material flow.

Due to its dusty nature, diatomaceous earth poses health risks if airborne particles are inhaled, potentially causing respiratory irritation or long-term conditions like silicosis. Handling this material requires careful dust control and engineered conveying solutions designed to address its flow irregularities and abrasive properties.
