## Salt

**Material page name:** Salt

**Hero Description:** Salt is a widely used material across industries including food processing, chemical manufacturing, and water treatment. Flexicon bulk material handling equipment is designed to move, store, and process salt efficiently while minimizing wear and contamination.

**Overview:** Salt, primarily composed of sodium chloride, is available in refined and unrefined forms and serves a broad range of industrial and commercial applications. Beyond its role in food production, salt is used in textiles, detergents, water softening, and as a de-icing agent for roads. Its versatility and commercial value make it a staple in manufacturing processes worldwide. Whether used in chemical processing or infrastructure maintenance, salt delivers consistent performance and utility.

**Characteristics and Challenges:** Salt is typically free-flowing and crystalline, available in granular, rock, or micronized forms. Its hygroscopic nature means it absorbs moisture from the air, which can lead to clumping and flow issues. To maintain consistent flow, flow agents may be added, and equipment must be built to withstand salt's abrasive and corrosive properties. Pneumatic conveying systems require properly sized blowers and may need moisture control devices to prevent clogs and degradation of salt granules. For corrosion resistance, 316L stainless steel is often recommended.

When salt arrives in bulk bags, discharge frames may need accessories depending on the salt grade and packaging quality. Flexible screw conveyors with round-profile screws are commonly used to handle salt's granular form. Hopper geometry is critical to avoid charging errors, and devices like vibrators or agitators may be needed to promote flow. For manual dumping, hopper screens help prevent foreign material entry and protect operators from moving parts.
