## Flour

**Material page name:** Flour

**Hero Description:** Flour is a fine, powdery substance produced by grinding, milling, or pulverizing grains, seeds, and roots. It is most commonly made from wheat and is the main ingredient in bread, a staple food in many cultures. Flexicon bulk material handling equipment is engineered to move, store, and handle flour safely and efficiently.

**Overview:** Flour commonly refers to wheat flour but can be made from many grains and roots such as rye, oats, rice, corn, taro root, and cassava, primarily for baking. The milling process separates the starchy endosperm from the grain kernel, reducing it to a fine powder suitable for various culinary uses. Flour's versatility extends across many food products and baking applications.

**Characteristics and Challenges:** Wheat grains are primarily made up of the starchy endosperm, which accounts for about 85% of the kernel, while the outer bran layer and nutrient-rich wheat germ make up the remainder. During the milling process, the endosperm is carefully separated and ground into fine, powdery flour particles. Flour typically flows freely but is highly aeratable, meaning it can become suspended in air easily and may flood or overwhelm conveying systems if not managed properly. These characteristics require specialized handling to ensure smooth, controlled material flow and to prevent disruptions in processing.

Flour dust is classified as a combustible dust by OSHA, posing a significant risk of explosions if proper precautions are not taken. When flour particles become airborne in sufficient concentrations and encounter an ignition source, they can create hazardous conditions leading to potentially devastating dust explosions. Therefore, effective dust suppression and collection systems are essential to minimize airborne particles and maintain a safe environment. Additionally, a thorough understanding of flour's unique flow properties is crucial to designing handling systems that prevent dust buildup and ensure smooth, reliable operation. Proper engineering and safety measures help protect both personnel and equipment while maximizing process efficiency.
