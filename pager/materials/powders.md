## Powders

**Material page name:** Powders

**Hero Description:** Powders are used across a wide range of industries, from food and pharmaceuticals to chemicals and construction. Flexicon bulk material handling equipment is designed to convey, store, and process powders with precision and care.

**Overview:** Powders encompass a broad category of dry organic and inorganic materials, typically formed through crushing, grinding, atomization, or other size reduction methods. They are essential in the production of everyday goods such as drink mixes, dairy products, vitamins, ceramics, cosmetics, and batteries. Powder handling is critical in industries like food, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and paints, where consistency, cleanliness, and efficiency are paramount. Flexicon systems are engineered to manage powders reliably, whether free-flowing or difficult-to-handle, while minimizing dust and maintaining product integrity.

**Characteristics and Challenges:** Powder flow characteristics are influenced by bulk density, particle size, shape, and cohesiveness. Blends of powders with varying properties can behave unpredictably, especially when exposed to moisture, temperature changes, vibration, or incompatible materials. These conditions may cause powders to aerate, fluidize, agglomerate, or degrade. Certain powders like flour or hydrated lime may bridge or rat-hole, while light powders such as fumed silica or talc can blind filters and escape into the environment. Others, like carbon black and titanium dioxide, are prone to packing and smearing, which can jam equipment and require extensive cleanup. Fat-rich powders like milk powder may leave residue in conveying lines, increasing contamination risks. Abrasive powders like micronized salt or sand can damage equipment, and blends with disparate particle sizes may separate, reducing product quality.

Dust generation is a major concern during powder handling, as it can contaminate the environment, pose health risks, and increase the potential for combustion or explosion. Regulatory bodies like OSHA classify dust as a key element in explosion risk, prompting strict containment requirements. Some powders are water-reactive, releasing heat or toxic gases upon contact with moisture, while others agglomerate and alter flow behavior. Flexicon addresses these challenges with dust-tight equipment and sealed connections to prevent dust escape and moisture intrusion. Bulk Bag Dischargers and Fillers feature secure seals and flow promotion devices to ensure clean, efficient transfer. Manual and container dumping stations incorporate dust collection systems to protect workers and maintain cleanliness. Conveying systems are selected based on powder characteristics, with vacuum pneumatic systems recommended for toxic powders to contain leaks and enhance safety.
