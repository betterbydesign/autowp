## Cocoa Powder

**Material page name:** Cocoa Powder

**Hero Description:** Cocoa powder is a fine, organic ingredient derived from roasted cocoa beans and widely used in food and confectionery. Flexicon's bulk material handling equipment is engineered to convey, store, and process cocoa powder with precision.

**Overview:** Cocoa powder originates from the beans (seeds) of cacao trees, a tropical plant grown in Africa, southeast Asia, Hawaii, Brazil, and other countries where rainforest conditions exist. Cocoa powder is a key ingredient in chocolate, beverage mixes, bakery, dairy, and confectionary applications, valued for its flavor, color, and functional properties.

**Characteristics and Challenges:** To retain its quality, cocoa powder must be stored cool, dry, and sealed to prevent moisture uptake, oxidation, or flavor loss. Flexicon equipment meets rigorous sanitary and dust-control standards, making it ideal for handling cocoa powder in food-grade environments.

Difficult to handle, cocoa powder cakes and packs easily and is hygroscopic - absorbing moisture and causing flow issues. Fine particles can fluidize and become airborne, leading to dust generation and density variations between batches. With its poor flow characteristics, cocoa powder will tend to "rat hole" or bridge in hoppers, completely blocking the flow of the material.
