## Talc

**Material page name:** Talc

**Hero Description:** Talc is a soft, naturally occurring mineral used in a wide range of industries, from cosmetics and ceramics to plastics and paints. Flexicon bulk material handling systems are engineered to move, store, and process talc efficiently while minimizing dust and product loss.

**Overview:** Talc, often recognized as the main ingredient in talcum powder, is valued for its moisture-absorbing, lubricating, and astringent properties. It is widely used in personal care products, ceramics, plastics, paints, and paper manufacturing. Talc's softness and chemical inertness make it ideal for applications requiring gentle handling and stability. Despite its versatility, talc must be handled with care to maintain product integrity and ensure workplace safety.

**Characteristics and Challenges:** Talc is a semi-free-flowing powder with hydrophobic, chemically inert, and slippery properties. It tends to smear and fluidize, behaving like a liquid, and becomes extremely difficult to manage when wet. To maintain flowability and prevent handling issues, talc should be kept dry and conveyed gently to avoid over-aeration.

Effective talc handling requires airtight systems, dust control, and flow-aid devices. Bulk bag dischargers should include features like spring-loaded frames and bag activators to ensure complete discharge, while dust collectors help maintain air quality. Manual dumping stations need filtration and pulse cleaning, and hoppers may require vibrators or screens for safe, efficient flow. Proper sensor selection and moisture control are also essential for reliable system performance.
