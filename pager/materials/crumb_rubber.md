## Crumb Rubber

**Material page name:** Crumb Rubber

**Hero Description:** Crumb rubber is a recycled material with a wide range of industrial and commercial uses, from road construction to playground safety surfaces. Flexicon bulk material handling equipment is engineered to convey, store, and process crumb rubber efficiently throughout your process.

**Overview:** Also known as ground rubber, asphalt rubber, or size-reduced rubber, crumb rubber is produced by grinding recycled tires into smaller particles. The demand for crumb rubber continues to grow alongside the increasing emphasis on recycled materials and sustainability. Its largest application is in asphalt rubber for highway construction, consuming millions of tires annually to enhance road durability. Beyond roadways, crumb rubber is used in playground surfaces, running tracks, soil additives, molded rubber products, automotive parts, and agricultural applications.

**Characteristics and Challenges:** Crumb rubber particles vary widely in size, shape, and color due to different processing methods and grades. Typically, it has a bulk density around 22 lb/cu ft but can include irregularly shaped particles that may vary within the same shipment. These variations require careful handling to maintain material flow and prevent agglomeration.

Crumb rubber has a natural tendency to clump together and cause blockages within conveying systems if not managed properly. This issue is particularly critical during pneumatic conveying, where the balance between air velocity and the specific grade of crumb rubber must be carefully controlled to prevent material segregation and plugging. Variations in particle size and shape can exacerbate flow problems, making it essential to use specialized equipment such as particle reduction devices or flow conditioners. These solutions help break down agglomerates, maintain consistent material flow, and ensure reliable, uninterrupted handling throughout the process.
