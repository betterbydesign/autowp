## Sodium Sulfate

**Material page name:** Sodium Sulfate

**Hero Description:** Sodium sulfate is a versatile compound used in industries ranging from glass and textiles to electronics recycling. Flexicon bulk material handling equipment is engineered to move, store, and process sodium sulfate efficiently and safely at every stage.

**Overview:** Historically known as "Miraculous Salt," sodium sulfate has evolved from medicinal use to industrial applications. It is widely used as a filler and leveling agent in glass manufacturing, textile production, and increasingly in gold recovery from electronics. While its role in detergents and paper has declined due to regulatory changes, sodium sulfate remains a valuable material. Most global production comes from natural sources like mirabilite, though it is also recovered as a byproduct from chemical processes.

**Characteristics and Challenges:** Sodium sulfate is typically free-flowing, crystalline, and dense, with an average bulk density of 85 lb/cu ft. It is also abrasive and hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air, which can affect flowability. Its granular nature makes it suitable for round screw designs in flexible screw conveyors.

Due to its abrasive and moisture-sensitive properties, sodium sulfate requires rugged, well-sealed conveying systems. Improper handling can lead to clumping, equipment wear, and flow disruptions, especially in humid environments.
