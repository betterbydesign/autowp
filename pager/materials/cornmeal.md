## Cornmeal

**Material page name:** Cornmeal

**Hero Description:** Cornmeal is a staple ingredient in global cuisine, used in everything from tortillas to baked goods. Cornmeal's versatility and nutritional value make it a reliable choice for commercial food production. Flexicon bulk material handling systems are engineered to move cornmeal efficiently, safely, and cleanly without compromising product integrity.

**Overview:** Also known as Indian meal, cornmeal is made by grinding whole corn kernels into smaller particles using either traditional stone mills or modern steel grinders. Stone-ground cornmeal retains more of the hull and germ, offering enhanced flavor and nutrition, while steel-ground cornmeal provides a longer shelf life. Cornmeal is a key ingredient in tortillas, cornbread, muffins, fritters, and hush puppies, and is also used in mixes for cereals, pancakes, and snacks.

**Characteristics and Challenges:** Cornmeal is available in a wide range of grades and granulations, including finer forms like corn cones used in bakery mixes and as a dusting meal. Most varieties have an average bulk density of 40 lb/cu ft, and their flow properties can vary significantly depending on particle size and moisture content.

Cornmeal's fine particles can segregate during processing, leading to inconsistent product quality. Additionally, cornmeal dust is combustible, making dust containment and explosion prevention critical in handling systems.
