## Citric Acid

**Material page name:** Citric Acid

**Hero Description:** Citric acid is a widely used organic compound found naturally in citrus fruits and commonly used in food, beverage, and industrial applications. Flexicon bulk material handling equipment is engineered to safely and efficiently convey citric acid through every stage of your process.

**Overview:** Also known as sour salt or citric salt, citric acid is a tart-tasting, crystalline substance extracted from citrus fruit juices. It's a key ingredient in food and beverage manufacturing, where it adds acidity to products like soft drinks and canned tomatoes. Citric acid is also valued for its firming properties and is generally recognized as non-toxic and safe for food use. Whether used in large-scale production or specialty applications, citric acid requires precise handling to maintain product integrity and process efficiency.

**Characteristics and Challenges:** At room temperature, citric acid typically appears as a white, crystalline powder. It can exist in either an anhydrous (water-free) form or as a monohydrate, which contains one molecule of water and converts to anhydrous when heated above 172°F (78°C). Citric acid is hygroscopic, meaning it readily absorbs moisture from the air, which can affect its flowability and handling.

Citric acid is both abrasive and corrosive, posing risks to gaskets and metal or non-metal components in conveying systems. Its tendency to solidify and agglomerate—especially in bulk bags—can make unloading difficult without mechanical assistance.
