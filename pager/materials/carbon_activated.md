## Carbon, Activated

**Material page name:** Carbon, Activated

**Hero Description:** Activated Carbon is a powerful absorbent used across industries for purification, filtration, and recovery processes. Flexicon bulk material handling equipment ensures safe, efficient, and dust-controlled movement of carbon, activated.

**Overview:** Activated carbons are produced by heating organic materials such as coal, wood, or fruit pits to high temperatures, creating a porous structure with exceptional surface area. This makes it ideal for capturing contaminants in applications ranging from water treatment and air purification to gold recovery and medical filtration. Available in powered (PAC), granulated (GAC), and pellet forms, carbon activated is selected based on pore size and application needs. Its versatility

**Characteristics and Challenges:** Activated carbon is extremely fine in powdered form, with an average particle size of just 20 microns and a low bulk density. It is highly aeratable, meaning even slight air movement can cause it to become airborne and settle as dust, coating surfaces and equipment. Some grades are flammable and may spontaneously ignite when exposed to air or moisture.

Activated carbon can fluidize and flood conveying lines, especially in powdered form. It also resists flow in granular form and may pose explosion risks, making dust control and safe handling essential.
