## Coffee

**Material page name:** Coffee

**Hero Description:** Coffee is one of the world's most popular beverages, valued for its bold flavor and natural caffeine boost. Flexicon bulk material handling equipment is designed to gently and efficiently convey coffee during processing and packaging operations.

**Overview:** Although commonly referred to as a bean, coffee is actually the seed of the coffee plant. It has long been a major cash crop and key export for many equatorial nations. The United States is the world's largest importer, with an estimated 150 million adults consuming coffee regularly. Flexicon systems are engineered to preserve the integrity of both whole beans and ground coffee, while supporting the demands of high-volume production.

**Characteristics and Challenges:** The density of a coffee bean affects both the strength of the brew and its packaging requirements. When coffee is packaged for bistros or aficionados who grind it themselves, it's essential to prevent degradation of the whole bean or ground form. This requires equipment that can withstand the abrasive properties of coffee.

Coffee beans are delicate and can crack or lose their kernel if conveyed too aggressively, which may compromise flavor and overall product quality. Flavored coffees—whether whole bean or ground—require special handling, as added oils and powders can cause equipment buildup and increase the risk of cross-contamination. Effective coffee handling demands equipment that minimizes breakage and prevents flavor transfer. Flavored varieties also require thorough cleaning between batches to ensure product purity and hygiene.
