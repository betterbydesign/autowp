## Hemp

**Material page name:** Hemp

**Hero Description:** Hemp is a renewable, multi-purpose crop grown for its fiber, seeds, and flowers. Used in everything from textiles to foods and nutraceuticals, it demands careful handling during processing. Flexicon bulk material handling equipment ensures hemp is transported, stored, and processed efficiently and safely.

**Overview:** Industrial hemp, a strain of Cannabis sativa, has been cultivated for thousands of years for paper, textiles, rope, and more. Today, it is used in a wide range of products, including foods, nutraceuticals, beauty items, insulation, biodegradable packaging, and construction materials. While hemp shares a genetic ancestry with marijuana, it contains less than 0.3% THC, the psychoactive compound. Legalized as an agricultural commodity under the 2018 Farm Bill, hemp production is now growing across the United States.

**Characteristics and Challenges:** Hemp consists of fibrous bast fibers surrounding a woody core known as hurds, which can be used in textiles, composites, animal bedding, and construction materials. Hemp seeds are pressed for oil and cannabidiol (CBD), or ground into flour and feed. Stalks, flowers, and seeds have irregular shapes and bulk densities, typically 10-12 lb/ft³ (160-192 kg/m³), and stalks and flowers can interlock, requiring careful handling to avoid plugging or binding equipment.

Hemp can be difficult to handle due to its irregular shapes, lightweight stalks, and interlocking fibrous nature, which can cause plugging or binding in convey lines and equipment. Seeds and flowers are friable and may degrade if conveyed too quickly or roughly, while fine particles can create dust that requires containment. Equipment used in food, nutraceutical, or personal care applications must meet strict hygienic standards. When unloading from bulk bags or containers, narrow openings and uneven flow can make complete evacuation challenging, often requiring flow promotion devices, vibratory hoppers, or sealed systems to ensure safe and efficient handling.
