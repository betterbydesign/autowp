## Calcium Carbonate

**Material page name:** Calcium Carbonate

**Hero Description:** Calcium carbonate is a versatile material used across numerous industries, including pharmaceuticals, construction and plastics manufacturing. Flexicon bulk material handling equipment is designed to transport, store and process calcium carbonate precisely at every stage.

**Overview:** Calcium carbonate (CaCO₃), also known as limestone, limestone flour, or powdered limestone, is one of the most widely used and versatile minerals in the world. It plays a critical role across industries—from enhancing the performance of plastics, paints, and adhesives to supporting environmental efforts like water treatment and soil stabilization. In the health and wellness space, calcium carbonate is valued as a dietary supplement that helps maintain strong bones, healthy muscles, a balanced nervous system, and a resilient heart. Whether you're developing industrial products or promoting personal well-being, calcium carbonate delivers consistent, proven benefits.

**Characteristics and Challenges:** Calcium carbonate's most common natural forms are chalk, limestone, and marble. Although all three forms are identical in chemical terms, they differ in many other respects, including purity, whiteness, thickness, and homogeneity. These differences often make the handling of calcium carbonate a complex proposition. Calcium carbonate powders can cause many problems in conveying systems, including sticking in hoppers, flood-feeding into convey lines, building up inside convey lines, and blinding over filter bags and cartridges in receives.
